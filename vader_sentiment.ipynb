It’s nice to have unlimited water It’s nice to have unlimited water. Think there is to many filters for me because the water tastes like distilled water which makes myself more thirsty. Other than that I am happy for the most part. \"READ AND FOLLOW\" the Instructions for setup to avoid any problems with the setup. We ordered 2 of these water dispenser and coolers for our Company - one of the office and one for our warehouse work area to fill the need of water supply for 2 large groups of employees in two separate work areas. Trying to eliminate the chore of having to purchase cases of bottle water several times a week! Set up a water delivery service and decided it would be better to purchase the cooler rather than paying a monthly rental fee on top of the water delivery service! Turns out to be a wise and cost effective purchase. This is a well known brand and has been very welcomed in the office. Unpacked, plugged in, loaded a bottle of water into it and ready to go!! Employees also like the feature of 3 water temps to choose from! ... for our home for a long time and so happy I stumbled upon this model Been on the market for a water dispenser for our home for a long time and so happy I stumbled upon this model! I wanted a top loader as I feel like bottom loaders doesn’t give me all my water and “empties” as good as top loaders do. This model also has three options: hot, warm or room temp, and ice cold. The hot water can get REALLY hot. Great for coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. Room temp water is a little more colder than warm but works the same. Ice cold water is AMAZING! The machine does have a reservoir, I think of 1 gallon, so when the machine is empty it’ll take a little, maybe 15-20 minutes, for the water to get cold again. Button on the side for hot and cold water.I gave a 4 star because I wish the space to put cups/bottles were a little bigger. I can’t put my 32oz flask on unless I take off the water catcher. But other than that works great!!! Five Stars Working great so far . Simple product that works well Simple cheap and useful, what more does anyone want? Best Cooler on the market for a great price! after reviewing a lot of different water coolers, I went all in and purchased this Brio Essential Bottom Load cooler and I have to say my family and I totally love it!! no more lifting heavy 5 gallon water jugs and killing your back for drinking water. This cooler is great because it does Hot/Cold water and has the option of an off switch if you just want regular room temperature water and also cuts your energy bill by turning off the Hot & Cold switch. Very easy setup, basically plug in and insert your 5 gallon jug at the bottom of the cooler and viola! you have clean purified drinking water and your back is not hurting. I definitely recommend this cooler as I have not been able to come up with any negative aspects of it other than perhaps at night if you want to get a cup of water and the lights are off there is no light on the spout or filler to indicate how full your cup is getting, I think a little light that lights up your cup as you fill it would make this cooler perfect but for me it's totally not a big deal or a deal breaker this cooler is still awesome!! I use to get water delivery service and the vendor rented me their cooler, but when you buy you save money this cooler pays for itself. No more rental fees from the water vendors & no more Chiropractic bills from throwing out your back on a top loading cooler :-) But with Amazon's great customer service we got a replacement fast that all ... The cooler works as advertised, the self cleaning mode works greats. Unfortunately the first one we got the colder water button would not pop back up it would only go half up. But with Amazon's great customer service we got a replacement fast that all the buttons worked fine. Very happy with the purchase. Finally glad we did We were talking about buying a cooler for years. Finally glad we did. Just great. Nor so hot on the hot water, but I bought it for the cold. So that is alright. Five Stars Love this water cooler!! Definitely recommend it Very nice! My son requested this for his new apartment.  So far, he loves it and says he's drinking a lot more water now! Great not having to lift bottles. Really enjoy the dispenser. I would actually give it five stars but it had a vibration noise when heating cooling that I had to place a piece of rolled up foil to buffer. Three Stars The button for the hot water is very hard to use, I am afraid that might break. Five Stars This is great water is really hot and the cold is cold. Love it.. is quite when it runs Style Price So far so good! Very pleased 1st off I'd like to day we have only tested it for a few weeks, but so far it's been great. It is pretty quiet and functions just as well. It would be nice if it had a night light, but we knew that ahead of time. I will say I really like how it has metal parts not just plastic. It even has a place to hang your spout when changing bottles. I definitely think this one is more robust and quieter than the premium model (Oasis brand) we were renting from Le Bleu. So far we are extremely pleased. Five Stars JUST WHAT WE WANTED, HOWEVER MORE! Good looking cooler Good water cooler. I think it looks nicer than other coolers at the same price range. Easy to setup, no problems so far. Annoying. I bought this water dispenser to eliminate the need for constantly buying the 32 cases of water. To be more eco-friendly I suppose. So I did a decent amount of research and decided on this one. It's so disappointing because for some reason it randomly shuts off. So the water that is supposed to be ice cold ends up just being room temperature. I'm not sure why it does this. So when it does this you have to go and unplug it just to get it to run properly again. Maybe mine is broken but this is the issue I have been having. I have only had this thing a week and am currently still on the first water bottle. Hopefully someone contacts me to tell me what I'm doing wrong or to replace this thing. I love this, its super quiet and the temp is ... I love this, its super quiet and the temp is very good. My only complaints: I wish there was a master on/off switch because when it runs low on water, the machine continues to run & you have to unplug it. Also, it needs to indicate which is room temp water and ice cold because honestly, both seem to come out almost the same temp. Not a biggie. Overall a good machine & worth the money. Great unit! Till today there are no issues Great unit!  Till today there are no issues.  I’d bought a unit previously which I had to return.  Brito is much better and $10 less! Works and looks great. My only complain is that the cold and ... Works and looks great.  My only complain is that the cold and room temp are about the same like the option of turning off hot dispenser as described.... cold and hot water....like the option of turning off hot dispenser...... instructions are a little weak.... don't give any info on the hot/cold switches One Star Slow Actually - I really like this unit Actually - I really like this unit.  It's quiet and dispenses the hot and cold water - well - either Very hot or Cold enough.I did see other reviews complaining about the LED Display being 'backwards' and that is true - but honestly - the button with the 'red safety switch' pretty much tells you which spout is going to deliver the hot water - left side for those that can't keep up.  And cold on the right side... isn't that the same way our US water faucets work?  Seriously?Great unit - recommended.  Functions as expected - would buy it again in an instant. The option for room temperature water is good to have Very quite compared to the Primo unit which i had before for 7 years. The option for room temperature water is good to have. An improvement on the door could be usefull by adding a hing to open the door properly...all in all a very effective water dispenser for household use so far. Would recommend for the price compared to other water dispensers at higher prices. Quality construction, quiet delivered in good condition, better water flow than previous cooler. Quiet operation Love the Brio Dispenser Love the Brio Dispenser.  It dispenses quickly and the bottom load feature makes it so much easier to change out the bottle. Extremely loud Works, but it's incredibly loud. Something is missing that's causing it to make a very loud annoying running sound. Five Stars Excellent product, very easy to use and change water.Ursula This water cooler is a perfect addition to my office This water cooler is a perfect addition to my office.  The water is not as cold as I am used to, but we got great service when we called for help... I’m very disappointed. Item is functional but It arrived with damaged faceplate. It is very noticable.  Contacted Brio twice for replacement faceplate.  No response yet. I’m very disappointed. Four Stars Love the water cooler but installation was difficult. Instructions are unclear and couldn’t find any assistance online. Five Stars Great equipment Gud purchase  worth the money Luv it cold water when needed hot when needed perfect Not bad at all. Contrary to other reviews I do not hear that it makes any noise at all. As for the buttons not matching the little drawings, it's pretty self explanatory the one with the big red button is obviously the hot. It's just a matter of using a little common sense. Excellent quality, looks great.  Recommend professional installation It looks great and produces an excellent quality of water! Hired a plumber to complete the install. The unit is in my kitchen but the plumber connected the tubing to pipes in the basement. It was to complex to self install. The part used to periodically clean the new carbon filters will need to be installed separate from the water depenser. Mine was connected to the utility sink in basement. No regrets, I strongly recommend this product. I enjoy having the water bottle on the bottom I enjoy having the water bottle on the bottom.  Much easier for me.  It's great to have the 3 water temperatures. Great looking and safe This is one of the best home cooling units I have ever had its compact the bottle goes in the bottom so it's not sticking out of the top it's got safety on the hot water so when my grandchildren come over they won't accidentally burn themselves Brio is a great product so you can't go wrong and buying this water cooler. Five Stars We are loving are brio water cooler. Great to Have. This is a very nice addition to our home. The instant an always available HOT water is very nice.The only thing that I would change is the \"Ready to use lights on the front of the cabinet.\"  The water dispensing buttons on the top are not marked and dispense water (from Right to Left) \"ROOM TEMP-COLD-HOT\". The Lights show (from Right to Left) ROOM TEMP- HOT- COLD). The HOT and COLD Lights should be swapped. One Star The dispenser was damaged to where it could not be used. sending it back. Pump stopped working I had this delivered on July 7, 2018.  It worked great up until a few days ago. Junk! Right out of the box, unit would not fill tanks...junk! Constantly runs! This is the lowest rating I have ever given on Amazon. This unit looks great. Dispenses the water fast, the cold is cold and the hot is hot. A major issue I am having (and I am hoping it's just a defect in mine) is it constantly runs. I turned off the hot (which is a nice option) but that didn't solve the problem. I have this unit indoors (constant 70 degrees in the house) so it isn't an ambient temperature issue. It is constantly chilling my water. It is louder than my refrigerator and never turns off. I am thinking about returning it. Love it! Out of the box and just plug it in. Switch for the hot water to be turned on is so easy to access right on the side. You can tell this is a well built system. I'm very happy I purchased this unit. Looks very nice too. Best water cooler! I highly recommend this dispenser especially to the elderly. Bottom loading is a God send ! Very easy to start up and use. Thank you Brio! And the safety feature for the hot water dispensing is an ease of mind, when the grandkids are around, they can't get burned.  I would recommend to anyone considering this purchase to get it. It's much nicer than any I could find in our local SAMs or Lowes. Awesome cooler! Love the cooler! Very easy to change a 5-gallon water container. No lifting is needed and you can simply roller the new container inside, unscrew the tap, and enjoy a cold glass of water. Quit working The unit I purchased just quit working a few days past the one month mark of purchasing it. The light comes on showing that the bottle is empty and needs to be replaced but it is a full bottle. There is no hot water and the cool water barely has a trickle of pressure. I'm disappointed and wish it could be replaced. Easy and convenient Came in a huge box but easy to open, I did miss the second button to turn it on but thankfully I found it before I freaked out. Instructions need some more details but I’ve had this now for over a month and love it. We use it for the home and it’s easy to transfer out the jugs. Cooler/heater Issue The cooler/heater stopped working on the day the return window closed. Unit has stopped working The unit I purchased just quit working a few months past the one month mark of purchasing it. The light comes on showing that the bottle is empty and needs to be replaced but it is a full bottle. There is no hot or cool water and the water barely has a trickle of pressure. I'm very unhappy and would like it replaced. Fantastic product No more plastic bottles, no more bottled water of uncertain source.  I made the switch to an in-home cooler/dispenser and I could not be happier.  Switching to the 5-gallon jug took a bit of an adjustment, bought the water at BJs and the biggest adjustment factor has been the taste... but that's a positive.  As much as I was used to taste of the 16-oz bottles, the new taste is great, the water is cold and refreshing, and all at a net savings.  Set up was easy, from removing it from the packaging to peeling off he protective wrapping, to plugging it in, slipping the bottle inside the machine, and enjoying my new savings.  Easy as pie. Fantastic RO water cooler Love this system, especially not having to carry and store the big bottles.  Best way to have hot and cold pure water without the hassle.  Had a plumber install but my husband could have done it. Wish I'd purchased one of these sooner. excruciatingly loud cools and heats well but it makes SO MUCH NOISE! Very quiet Works great, water is hot and cold as it expected to be. Regular temperature option is a good idea, it is useful, but it usually has a pretty low temperature, not room at all. Doesn't produce any noise Scratched up to big to return Mine came all scratched up, looks like someone else returned it... and constantly buzzes so loud. Very upset Water outlet too low Sent back. Water outlet too low No longer works after less than one month of usage. I purchased this cooler on July 17th, 2018 and as of August 15th, 2018 it has stopped working.  The \"Replace Bottle\" light keeps flashing even when a full bottle is inserted.  It seems like it's trying to pump water into the cooling tank based off of the status lights on the front of the cooler, but then it always reverts back to the \"Replace Bottle\" light flashing red.  We were really excited about having this for our clients, but less than one month later it no longer works. Disappointed Mine stopped working after 1 month. Stopped working after 1 month I have had it for 1 month and it quit working Five Stars GREAT PRODUCT This water cooler works great. Well worth the money and I received it ... This water cooler works great. Well worth the money and I received it in no time. I would recommend it. The temperature settings are excellent! It was super easy to set up. I’ve had it for about a month and it’s been working very well. The hot water is very hot and the cold is very cold. It’s easy to switch out the water jugs.  I will say at first I thought something was wrong because in the picture the Brio logo appears to be backlit making it a bright blue. However in person, there is no back lighting behind the logo. It’s a sticker that is a dark blue and not easily visible on the black machine.  But overall, it’s a well functioning machine with a sleek design.  I’ve already recommended it to a friend. Worked amazing for the 1st month Worked great for the first month. Now when i replace water I hear the motor running for a long time and then the red light flashes saying it needs to be changed..  Frustrating Great water dispenser, vibrates loudly at times I really like this water dispenser. Just wish it was quieter...sometimes it starts vibrating loudly. Broke in less than a month The water dispenser broke in less than a month. It leaked all over my kitchen and dining area for no apparent reason..... Not worth the money. I've had this for 40 days and the pump already stopped working. Garbage. Works great but the room temp water is more cold then ... Works great but the room temp water is more cold then room temp. I just do half cold and half hot water to get that temp. Hot is very very hot Love it. Had it for a month now. Matches all of our other appliances and just quietly sits there with cold water on tap. We got what we wanted. UPDATED: Better the second time around. UPDATED FROM PRIOR REVIEW: The seller responded to my review and sent us a new unit. It works much better. I still wish the hot and cold water was a little more consistent but the new dispenser provides much better heating and cooling. The buttons do not stick and the pressure is better. I appreciate the seller's willingness to work with us on this and, because of this, would recommend trying this unit out.We bought this in May 2018 to replace one from another company we had for years. We loved the look of it and the bottom loading water option. Unfortunately, this machine is truly lousy. It doesn't produce cold water consistently, the buttons get stuck, the hot water isn't always hot enough. It's hard to get the water jug hooked up right and the water pressure is terrible. I miss our old, ugly water dispenser. Five Stars Very good product, excellent quality... Great, for a month, then broke This was rear until it stopped working.  After a month of use the pump stopped pumping water to be dispensed. Five Stars Loved this water dispenser Don’t order this is my second one This is the worst product I’ve ever ordered from amazon. It keeps shorting out and now it won’t work at all. IT LEAKS It LEAKS!!! We Have only used it for 2 weeks!! Works good! Works good! Hit and miss I bought this and it worked for about a week and a half then stopped producing cold water.  Did not want to wait for an exchange, so I ordered another one and as soon as that one was plugged in, it made loud noises/vibrations... and not good vibrations like The Beach Boys song. That one was sent back too.  I gave up.Strangely, I’ve had good experience so far with another one before this purchase. I wish they were consistent. Not reliable Stopped drawing/dispensing water properly after 6 months of normal use. Great Product Works great, looks good.  Very quite operation.  Cold water gets very cold.  Very happy with this product. Es bien ueno Bueno Great Water Cooler!! Looks Great; easy to setup; water is nice and cold and it is a wonderful addition to our family room, replacing our old water cooler that lasted many years. This cooler looks a lot nicer and is quieter than our old one! Thanks! Defective It’s defective does not work todo bien todo bien Do not purchase Extremely noisey.  This unit rattles all day long and sounds horrible Terrible quality! Do NOT buy this item! I ordered it back in April and it’s already broken! I wish I could return it as it’s so expensive and I was expecting something of good quality! What a disappointment. It doesn’t have a light like my old one but still nice. Very nice cooler! Good machine so far. I’ve been using this for about a month, and it has been working exactly like it should. It’s easy to load and unload/switch water bottles. The hot water is VERY hot. The cold water is arctic. For the price, i would expect better Adjusting rating. It worked for a solid two months and then just stopped working. Great while it worked but now it has the constant red flashing light, no matter what I do. Leaving the two stars for look and ease of use while it was working Garbage product Broke after 2 months, garbage product!!! Water stopped  coming out of dispensers. Waste a lot of water I don’t like this product, because it waste a lot of water. In order to get 2 glasses of clean water, it dumped over a gallon of water. Stopped Working Within weeks of purchase the machine has stopped working - RED light came on despite of a brand new OZARKA bottle replaced three times. WASTE OF MONEY, WASTE OF TIME AND WASTE OF WATER. I will not advise to buy this USELESS machine. Great purchase! Been using it for over a week now, it’s great. Don't buy this product I do not recommend this product. It died just after 5 months of use. The motor, when it did work was very loud. I am giving it a star because it did work, if only temporarily. I spent way too much money for it to no longer work! Extremely disappointed! Does not work Just received mine yesterday and the cold and hot water does not work. Troubleshoot and it says turn on the hot water switch in the back.....there is no switch. Works great! One of the best purchases we’ve made. Hot, cold, or temperature water right away. So happy so far! Push buttons stick then it dumps your water all over the place. The push buttons to dispense the water are made of thin plastic and spring load. When pushed down the buttons stick. They do not pop back up. The water keeps pouring out. This happens with both the refrigerated cold and the room temperature buttons. I did not try the hot water button in fear it would burn my feet. Not good. The picture shows the button stuck in the dispense position with water all over the floor. I had to pull the 3 gallon water jug off to avoid flooding. We have a butter knife next to the cooler to pop the button back up.  But, you need to be ready with a bucket or an empty jug to grab the water . I don’t understand this damn machine!! There is ... I don’t understand this damn machine!! There is no cold water and where there is a picture of snow flake, boiling water coming out!! I’m about to return this thing!! It doesn’t seem to be working right!! Like the hidde bottle Least like difficulty in finding water ... Like the hidde bottleLeast like difficulty in finding water outlets Breaks Bought in June and stopped working. The refil indicator is flashing and no water is dispensing. Also, the hot water button started to stick.  I’ve trouble shot every possible scenario and nothing is working. I’m contacting the company next. Love it This was an excellent addition to our kitchen. The family drinks so much more water now and we have hot water in demand. It’s easy to use as well. Love it. Do Not Buy! Terrible! We should have returned it a month after we bought it but instead we’ve been dealing with it. Sometimes it works ok but usually it thinks the bottle is empty when it’s not. This is perfect! No hum Looking for a cooler that doesn't make noise! This is perfect! No hum. Cheap and useless - Broke completely within 6 months No customer support, no product manual to troubleshoot an issue, no warranty information, no contact to resolve the issues. This is called a RIP OFF  PRODUCT!Noisy, leaky and very cheap quality. It stopped functioning completely with the red LED blinking continuously despite water in the bottom load.Amazon should ban such cheap quality products sounds like screws missing around cabinet of it the unit vibrates loud, sounds like screws missing around cabinet of it. Great machine. Quiet. Great hot and cold water. The dispenser is clean looking. Not too tall. Easy to load. It arrived quickly. Worth every penny. Crappy product. Period. Product is not very sturdy, doesn’t heat or cool water very well, stopped working after a couple months and leaked water ALL over my kitchen!!  What a waste of my birthday $$. Could not find the correct replacement filters. We like this water dispenser. However, I would not recommend buying it because there are no replacement filters available. Their website is not helpful. Broke in 6 months I bought this in JUNE it has not been 6 months and it is BROKEN. WASTE OF MONEY Please stay away from this unit. As the others have stated, 6 months and the pump goes out. Well this unit was ordered for a senior due to weight constrictions and lifting, failure of the pump in such a very short period with Bottled purified, plain old water from A major Supplier that has ahem, so standards, water to fail is not tolerated at all. 5+ months and about 600 gallons later, pump failure is unacceptable. Warranty is a joke. Now this entire unit is hazardous waste due to Freon and oil. It stopped working after 3 months Don’t buy this! I purchased one for my house and one for my sister. Mine stopped working in 3 months and hers stopped working after 4 months. The water wouldn’t come up from the bottle. We had to return them to amazon and bought another brand. The only good thing I can say about it is that it looks really nice. Looking nice is not gonna cut it when u can’t even get a year out of the product great customer service had a problem with the first one received with hot water leaking. called Brio warranty and they where excellent couldn't be fixed so they sent me a new one as soon i the broken was mailed out. customer service was excellent. Failed after eight months with no warranty I spent one-fourth of a month's rent on this thing, and it failed after eight months... It constantly tells me I need to refill the water, but I have a full bottle in there. Opened it up and fiddled with it, cleaned the water tank... Nothing :/And there's no warranty, to boot!Save your money and buy one with a warranty. Worked Great for 9 months...now leaking The product worked great for less than 9 months.  Very hot water.  Very cold water.  A little buzzy during heating and cooling, but not too bad.  Yesterday, I noticed a flood in my kitchen.  The product is now leaking and unusable.  I am unable to contact the seller about this order through amazon.  There is no warranty info.  Very disappointing.  I spent $180 on this. STOPPED WORKING I bought this water cooler July 19th 2018, it started making VERY loud noises by the end of August. Unplugged it a few times and re plugged it and it eventually stopped making the noises. We were VERY happy with this cooler, when it worked! We even had the next door office coming by and using our water because they enjoyed it much more! By the beginning of October, it just stopped working all together. I Have been trying to return the item but there is no information on how or where to return the product or at least get a refund from the broken cooler. I am very disappointed in regards to the service since there is no where to hear from or point of contact. Originally a 5 star cooler turned to 1 star instantly. Very disappointed. IT DOESN'T WORK LIGHTS FLASH THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN THEM OFF .  I HATE THIS ITEM AND WISH TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. Stopped working within 6 months Stopped working right around the 6 month mark. Refill light continues to blink even with full water bottle in place. BUYER BEWARE - No Replacement Filters Available! Nice machine until it's time to replace filters.  Replacement filters not found ANYWHERE!!!  Was directed by Brio to contact Organize.  What a pathetic joke they are.  No one there answers the phone during normal business hours and they never return messages.  Their website is useless because there are no pictures of the filters so you have no clue what you're looking at.  DO NOT BUY!  You'll be putting it on the boulevard for garbage pick up when filter replacement time comes around.  Everyone involved in the sale and manufacture of this needs to be ashamed, or sued. GREAT PURCHASE! Great product! We wasted SO much money on water bottles for the office and now that we have this installed it saves so much money on bottles and is very clean looking. Love that it does both HOT & COLD water. Perfect for making instant coffee or hot chocolate of even adding it to your Cup Ramen! Five Stars This is so much easier to use than the top load unit we had before! Highly recommend this cooler! Love this water cooler/heater! Sleek look, easy setup, quiet, simple to load. No weird taste in the water like there is in the top loading coolers when they are new. A couple of suggestions to the seller... include a shorter feed tube for the option to use 3 gallon water jugs and it would make more sense to line up your cooling and heating indicators with the buttons that dispense the cool and hot water. A bit confusing for some. ANOTHER GREAT BRIO Awesome cooler looks similar to the filter cooler we purchased from brio the quality is great water is cold and they offer great technical support on setting up the unit. Five Stars great product would buy again Great product. Disagree with some reviews Great product. Disagree with some reviews. The buttons aren’t labeled but easy to figure out.  Not always making noise and when does turn on not loud at all. The hot water is good enough for tea. The bottom load just seems less cluttered also and easy to swap water bottles. ... and opened it and ill tell you this is great no damage at all i plugged it up and ... this is boxed extremely well i got it out and opened it and ill tell you this is great no damage at all i plugged it up and waited to see how hot the water got it didnt take long  the  child proof lock on it works well so i dont have to worry about any accidents and ill tell you that is why i got this for this  for that and the price and i love the fact of the anitbacterial shield overall this is great no problems with it at all im glad i bought it Disclosure: “I have been given  this product as part of a product review .

Brio Commercial Grade Bottleless Ultra Safe Reverse Osmosis Drinking Water Filter Water Cooler Dispenser-3 Temperature Settings Hot, Cold & Room Water - UL/Energy Star Approved - Point of UseSome background information about myself. I live alone and am a student. Given these circumstances, I need to be as efficient as possible. I stumbled across this future-esque product. Not only was I extremely happy about my purchase, but it blew my expectations. In terms of efficiency, it doesn't get any better than this. It comes with a room temperature water dispenser, hot, and cold! Longevity wise, this product is going to last for many years to come (stainless steel). It looks amazing, high-tech, but don't let that fool you it's extremely user friendly and easy to use for the average consumer. It has a four-stage reverse osmosis system which cleans, purifies, and keeps water flowing at a proper pressure.Switching from water bottles to this has saved me a lot of money. When I have a guest that comes over, I can make them a coffee/tea, give them ice cold water, or room temperature water in seconds.Best water product on the market hands down. Five Stars Exactly as descibed - fast delivery One Star this cooler failed after 3 days of use, no warm water !!! requested replacement, no work from the seller ... lot of noise as well would have bought something better if I would've known The pump makes to much noise when you go to get water and it keeps on trying to get water when it is empty have to unplug the heater for the hot said makes a lot of noise as well would have bought something better if I would've known Just need An answer!! Cannot get an answer from anybody!!! The room temp water is almost as cold as the cold water. is this normal ? Do I need to return. Cannot find customer service phone or email. Five Stars just what I wanted nice and look good set up. Five Stars works great we love it very much Don't buy this! I liked the size and that the hot water was plenty hot. Beyond that it was terrible! It's super loud, at times the \"room temp\" water would come out hot and in only 2.5 months it completely broke and water was everywhere coming from where the motor cools it. Not a problem caused by overfilling. I would not recommend it to anyone! If yours stop working (Dispensing Water) FYIA quick and easy solution to the issue where it is a bit noisy or where is just continues to make a sound and never will dispense water.Just move the bottle out a bit to where you have access to the small pump in the top right corner inside (just follow the water tube from bottle) and simple take about 4 inch piece of electrical tape and wrap it firmly around tube connection to pump  on both the front and the back.The pump needs a good seal to create a siphon and the water connection(s) to the pump are a weak spot and with pulling out the water bottle during change you place a bit of strain on that connection. Hot water button sticks. Be careful!  I bought this water dispenser in Late July 2018. Up until a few weeks ago, we loved it. Recently, the hot water button (child lock) becomes stuck when using it. getting the button to free up and stop dispensing near boiling water is the hard part. I am unsure if anyone else has run into this issue. I did contact Amazon but the informed me that it was passed the return date within their policy (30 days) and put me in contact with the seller. The seller response so far has be the following, \"Thank you for reaching out to us!We sincerely apologize for your inconveniencesWe have brought this product issue to our R and D department and once we have a response from them, we will emailwith either troubleshooting instructions for this product or a resolution if we were recommended from the R and D department to proceed further.We thank you for your continued patience and understandingBest regards\"If they do come up with a resolution, I will update this review.(02/04/19) Great product, very hot and cold water Great product, very hot and cold water, very happy, only thing i wish is it had a light but not that big of a deal Can't find the replacement filters. I would not recommend buying it because there are no replacement filters. Great item! It's a great item. I've had it for a year without any problems. I really like it! Impossible to clean and gets moldy! The water dispenser worked fine but after two months of using it the water tasted dusty and dirty when dispensed from the Brio. It was collecting mold and there is no way to clean it. Do not buy this dispenser or if buying make sure there is a servicing contract that includes cleaning the dispenser. This is of no use for us unless we clean the mold out. Work good Work great!!! Bring all the stuff needed to install it. But instructions of how operate it are incomplete. Does Not have instructions about the switches at the back of water cooler. Switches aren't labeled also. easy to set up and we are thrilled with it My husband and I had rented a cold/hot water dispenser from our local water company for years.  We had been having it replaced several times over the years and finally decided we would buy our own.  We are getting up in years and wanted one that we did not have to lift the heavy 5 gallon jug of water (which was getting really hard to lift) over our heads.  We did our research and this Brio seemed to fill the bill.  It came quickly, easy to set up and we are thrilled with it.  Only problem is the lights.  They certainly are screwy.  The cold and hot lights are switched.  Sometimes they work, most of the time they don't.  We have just learned to adjust; and after reading other reviews we discover that this is a common problem and it is not worth the cost of sending the product back.  With just the two of us in the house to educate about the \"light situation\" it is not an issue for us.  We live in the country and have well water. We prefer not to drink the water.  Therefore, this is our answer for pure drinking water that is delivered to our door.  It is an attractive unit and we are very happy with our purchase.  Thank you!! Great Product 01/11/2019 - I purchased this water cooler in August, 2018 - So far, so good. Out of the box, no problems.  I like the fact that I can turn-off the hot water, the cold water and have water at room temp (in the summer I enjoyed the really cold water), now it's winter and room temp is perfect for me.  I use the hot water (and its good and hot) each morning for coffee (then I turn it off).  At the time I purchased this item, the price was $149.99, zero s/h as I'm a prime member. Motor burned up! I’m really disappointed to have to report that I bought this machine in July and the motor is already broken in late December. I paid too much for it not to last even six months! Operates fine. Water is very cold/hot when selected Ehh... It's just okay. Buttons feel cheap. Needs a light for dispensing water st night. Operates fine. Water is very cold/hot when selected. Not very loud either. I'd say it's just \"okay\" Extremely Disappointed I purchased this cooler on August 18th, 2018 and as of January 12th, 2018 it has stopped working. The \"Replace Bottle\" light keeps flashing even when a full bottle is inserted. It seems like it's trying to pump water into the cooling tank based off of the status lights on the front of the cooler, but then it always reverts back to the \"Replace Bottle\" light flashing red. I was extremely excited about about this unit. As a single mother it was a blessing. However, now it’s a huge hardship on me and my family. I’m so sad now. If you like throwing your money away by this product The pump stopped working with in maybe 15 5 gallon bottles horrible product would not wish this for anyone to own and less you like wasting your money If anything happened to my cool the can  fix it for me It is the great water cooling I like it so much it is helpful For me and my family the only thing they didn’t put the name on  top of machine and the signs for the water  so you can know if it’s cold or hot I do not recommend Pump broke after 6 months So far so good - it was packaged really good - not a ... So far so good - it was packaged really good - not a scratch on it. Also the water is very cold and the hot is very hot I say this bc I had issues in the past with other cooler vendors that the water was barely cold .. this one is cold. So far a great purchase. Shame on you Brio. Every here of water shortage or how about a water bill? DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ENERGY OR MONEY ON THIS SELF CLEANING WATER COOLER BY BRIO.  AFTER HAVING BUYING THIS PRODUCT AND PAYING FOR IT TO BE PROFESSIONALLY INSTALLED,  THATS WHEN THE HORROR HAPPENED. Mind you first of all this is an energy star, i wonder if energy star knows how wasteful this PRODUCT is. For every cup of water you pure to consume at LEAST 10 times that runs through the waist line . This product will cost a fortune in water bill alone. Irritated Mine started leaking! It was working great till one day we came home and water was all over the floor. Broken 2x in less than a year About to replace this poor purchase.  At the time I bought it had good reviews.  Within a few months it started making a loud noise then stopped working.  We had it replace, but the company wanted me to pay for shipping the broken one.  Got the replacement and again it broke.  Don't waste your money. Grear value for your money so far so good. just wish there was a standard no-spill cap with it. our last one did but it costed a lot more 5 years ago. Thumbs up ! A must have for health This is the only company using copper free internal parts and non bpa plastics . Awesome to know they went the extra step in engineering ! Much appreciated No cold water... The unit is heating water across across cold, room, and hot temperatures. No cold water...returning. Good Good Lasted only 6 months I am very disappointed in this product. I purchased 2 of them and within 6 months both were malfunctioning. Now I am stuck with 2 water coolers I can't use or return. Will not and did not buy item again. BEST COOLER OUT OF 4 DIFFERENT ONES I purchased this cooler for my kitchen as a gift for my parents anniversary I am very impressed with the shiny stainless steal on the front panel. I purchased a few other ones less expensive for my garage and my parents garage how ever the additional 50-75$ we paid for this cooler was worth every penny, you truly get what you pay for.The cooler makes very cold water and the hot is very hot, hot enough to make tea, out my favorite cup of noodles I really like that. Some of the other coolers I purchased were not as cold. There user manual really helps you get set up make sure to readFor sure buy.!!!!! One Star Please don't buy it Does not work!!! I am on #4...none of them worked. you follow the set up directions and everything seems to be working fine then it starts spitting and leaking water all over inside and out. I have wasted 4 different 5 gallons of bottled water. We took video and pictures of the malfunctioning machines and worked with the company that ships them and they sent out stickers for shipping for return and replaced them 4 times but I am tired of packing them up and sending them back. Maybe because we live above 9400 Feet above sea level is the reason they do not work. Time to try a different one. STOPPED 200+ $$$ broken We purchased this dispenser in August 2018 5 month not pumping water red light stays on this is unacceptable Amazon should help the customers who this supplier will not support Unable to get replacement filters for this cooler. Unable to get replacement filters for this Water Cooler.  Everyone is having the same problem. No cold water I lmreally likes the water cooler until about a mont ago (I bought in October) the cold water started making a noise and is no longer working The pitcher leaked one month into owning the device. ... The pitcher leaked one month into owning the device. Buy at your own risk. I'll purchase a different brand.One star is if you only need the thing for a month. Love the bottom load! Love this with the room temperature option. Bottom load is so much easier. Matches with other kitchensppliancrs Works very well. Nice looking too. Never order this product Worst water dispenser I have ever ordered. It’s been only theee months and it broke already Pretty decent Some hum when the condenser is running but not intrusive. The bottom grill where spill water collects is a bit flimsy Five Stars I am very happy with this product it works great Doesnt work. I was really excited for this dispenser. Instructions said to keep upright for minimum of 2 hours before hooking up. Did that and nothing happened. Left it standing over at home while at work, came home and still not working. Will be returning.  What a let down. Two Stars Its now a few months after purchase and the water pump has gotten much louder. The reviews are true Totally worth it.  It tucks away nicely.  The hot/cold/room temp water is really nice to have.  So much easier than having a top loading unit. It’s very easy to set up and use It’s only been a few days but I reallly appreciate having water so readily available.  It’s very easy to set up and use. Compre este producto debido a las buenas recomendaciones que tenia ... Compre este producto debido a las buenas recomendaciones que tenia  y  me gustaba su funcionamiento. me sentía a gusto con el pero en menos de tres meses se me rompió. dejó de funcionar. actualmente no puedo devolverlo ni cambiarlo. recomiendo a todo el que lo compre lo asegure pues el plazo de devolución es muy corto. The hot water is extremely hot and is good for making green tea Can't figure out how to work the cold water. The hot water is extremely hot and is good for making green tea. LOVED IT TILL IT STOPPED PUMPING LESS THAN 3 MONTHS IN JUNE 9, 2018LOVE IT. OUR OLD ONE FINALLY QUIT. I LOVE THIS ONE  BECAUSE OF THE EASY ACCESS TO LOAD IN THE BOTTLED WATER. OUR OLD ONE I HAD TO LIFT UP TO THE TOP IF HUBBY WASN'T HOME. THIS ONE SLIDES EASY IN THE BOTTOM. NICE AND COLD! AUGUST 6, 2018.....THAT COMMENT WAS WHEN I BOUGHT IT......3 DAYS SHORT OF IT TURNING 3 MONTHS OLD, IT STOPPED WORKING. THANKS TO MIKE B. FROM AMAZON WHO HELPED ME RESOLVE THE ISSUE. BRIO SUCKS...BUT THEIR PUMPS DON'T....NOT IN MY CASE ANYWAY. Easy, Refreshing, sleek design This has made our life so much easier! Very easy to set up, and water comes out cold/hot as expected. Looks much sleeker than most water coolers. I would recommend! Stopped working after 45 days The red blinking empty bottle light is always on and no water comes out even if there is a full bottle Broken items always!!! This I as my second time dealing with this brand !Its most BAD brand ever !!!😡 Runs quiet just be sure to follow set up instructions so as not to ruin it. Water bottles are easy to load so even my wife can do it.It seems that the cold water isn't always cold ,sometimes it doesn't seem to chill the water. Five Stars good quality! Not a complete product This product don't come with the required filters so far its working great! hot is very hot and cold is very ... have had this for about  months.  ordered and had it shipped directly to my office.  no problems with shipping (no crushed box, etc).  so far its working great!  hot is very hot and cold is very cold.  has a  room temp spout which i wasn't expecting but is a nice addition. Four Stars As described Being a little old I really like that I can load the bottle from bottom and ... Being a little old I really like that I can load the bottle from bottom and not from the top, those do get heavy as you age. The only small problem I have is there is no light to see when you fill a cup/glass. But all in all it is a great product. Broken in 1-2 months. Adjusted Rating. This product works for about 1-2 months. Now not only does it not work, but the is no customer service. I have been trying to find customer service for this product and there doesn't seem to be any. I am so thirsty and angry I wish I never bought this brand. See for yourself, there is no customer service for this product according to google. And all of the Youtube videos focus on different brands. Good quality Easy to set up and easy to load. Works great! One Star looked good but worked for a month only and now it is useless Five Stars There is really nothing I didn't like. Good product. Do not buy After two months the red flashing light stays on and it will not pump water. Tried all the repairs suggested and it’s still not working. Expensive machine to have break so quickly. Would not buy again and of course it’s just outside of the return window. This makes drinking water fun! way cheaper rand easier option than plastic bottles This makes drinking water fun! way cheaper rand easier option than plastic bottles. Reduce my plastic footprint one bottle at a time. Five Stars So far it is the best water dispenser I have ever owned I love my new water dispenser I love my new water dispenser. It is good looking, works great and is very quiet. I like that I can shut off (with a button on the side) the hot or cold water should I want to. I actually only need hot water on for cooking purposes etc. I am very pleased with it so far after about a months time and would highly recommend it. Stopped working after less than 60 days. I was very happy with this water dispenser until it completely stopped working after less than 60 days. Amazon was responsive and allowed me to ship it back to them for a refund minus a fee, but it was still a hassle to box it back up. I called the number on the warranty card (Downtown wholesalers) and they were nice enough, but they said I had to work through Amazon. You might want to try a different brand or model. Five Stars great water cooler Stay Away Bought it 3 month ago, already replaced once and it does not work well.  First one would not heat the water after one month.  Second one heats the water too much so some plastic inside melts and ends up in the water.  Stay Away.Don't even know how to return to Amazon now. Light doesn't work. Space for bottles is too short ... Light doesn't work.  Space for bottles is too short.  Platform to rest cup/bottle is not deep enough to support my glassware. Good price Very good has cold cold water and hot water 5 stars for this one Five Stars perfect size fits just about any tight space. makes no noise and water is cold instantly. Perfect Exactly what we wanted and quick shipping Trash Trash Good quality and good price Couldn’t beat the price. I was looking for a bottom loading water dispenser and could not find one for a reasonable price until I came across this one. Very clean looking with the stainless steel finish and makes water ice cold ! Good quality ! Five Stars Much easier to load water than the top-loading ones. Leaks water all over Terrible, leaks water and amazon customer service sends you to the manufacturer whom doesn’t want to help as well. Will never buy again ! I need someone fix . Product is not work after 1 month. Defective product.  Company not easy to work with. Product was defective.  Months later I am still waiting for a full refund. Cold & Hot water with style So far so good, 4 bottles later and I still love this.  I understand the reviewers who really want the lights to align to the buttons, but the lights really only lite up to tell you it's cooling or heating the water (they're not on most of the time).  Detects an empty bottle spot on.  Very easy to replace bottles and awfully smart that they have a hook to hang the siphon assembly.  Whisper quiet (though sometimes you need to move a new bottle around slightly so it's not pushing anything in a way that causes vibration).Right is cold, left is hot (with the safety), middle is room temp.  Cold is satisfyingly cold.  No complaints at all, would buy another. Great tasting water We bought this cooler for in home use and had a plumber install it. So far this water cooler has met our expectations, the water taste great, and the hot water spout is great for a quick cup of tea. My only concern so far is that I haven't been able to find replacement filters. We still have a while before we have to replace them but the fact that they are not already available concerns me. Stop looking at reviews. Best value for the money. It works great and the bottom storage is great. To address some reviews yes indicator lights are“backwards”So what!Look at your sink left is HOT.  Easy to help those who need help put a label on it. Had some noise at first but that was the fill hose against the cabinet. Easy fix. Just move it.  The only thing I can’t review is the reliability. Only a few weeks old, But seems to be built well. Good: -Bottom loading is so convenient Good:-Bottom loading is so convenient.-Hot or cold water is a nice touch versus just room temp.-Saves space and looks high-end.Bad/Irritating:- Buttons on top don't have the same order of the Hot/Cold/Room Temp icons on front. This is a bit annoying because there are 3 separate nozzles for dispensing the water. Pick the wrong one and you have spills, and with hot water, that could be bad.- Reservoir for hot or cold water is too small. It runs out quickly and then takes a long time to prepare the next batch of hot or cold water. easy to change water bottles very quiet. easy to change water bottles. Exactly what I wanted Gives very old and very hot! Very satisfied! Arrived damaged. Product arrived damaged so it was returned. Great product! Would highly recommend this water cooler.  Hot water is very hot.  I use it to speed up cooking.  Perfect for our lake house where the water is not good to drink. Ease of bottom loading is wonderful. Would recommend this product. Five Stars After less than one month of use, one of the three water spouts started leaking. The amount water leaking out of it was enough to fill a glass in about 10 minutes. We had to return the water dispenser. Searching on advertise Good Unsatisfactory Bought this item and broke 1 month later. Never moved it or did anything to it and now it doesn't work Bought it in March and in June it isn't working anymore... It doesn't want to pull the water up no more Clean and easy to load! Great product! Arrived on time, & in excellent (new) condition. Start up procedure went without a hitch. This unit is a great looking addition to our kitchen! Easy to use Easy to set up. Very quiet. Hot water is very hot. Cold takes a few seconds, but the operation of this equipment is fine. Child proof hot water. Its all that it says it is! And child proof for the hot water! Unit Completely stopped after less than 90 days. Unit completely failed working within 90 days. Unfortunate as it worked well before that but I can  Not Recommend no longer than it actually functioned at the price. I don’t wanted to see it any single time. There is no cold water, the two lights on blink non stop.I never think it will be returning, so my husband discarded the box,I will take it back to the Amazon to fix for me or give me the new one. Please would you like to give me the right address of Amazon in Minnesota. Thank you because it so effected me a lot. Don’t purchase this After one week of use, I came into my kitchen to see the water pouring out of the spout without any of the buttons being pressed or stuck. the customer service was excellent, and I received a full refund The hot/cold water stop working after a few weeks of purchasing. It only produced warm water. Although the product didn't work, the customer service was excellent, and I received a full refund. Four Stars It works and is great so far. I have not had any issues yet. Cold and hot water. I was significantly disappointed in this cooler I was significantly disappointed in this cooler. The cold water is simply not cold enough. My last, much cheaper, cooler had a temperature gauge and the water could me made to be very cold. Based on the high ratings of this cooler on Amazon, I would have thought I was going to receive an upgrade, not lose features. Dented because packaging sucked. The aluminum part is weak and came in dented greatly. The heating part isn't working correctly. Quick and Easy Set Up, Works as Advertised I don't like leaving reviews when I haven't had the product for very long, but I'll give it to this oneIt was very easy to set up, its hot and cold functions were ready fairly quickly, the instructions were very clear, and the bottom loading option is really nice, no splashed water on my floorI was a little confused between what button was for cold and what was for room temp when we first set it up, but it only takes one time of pouring room temp water to figure out that's not the cold button.I'll also note unlike top loaded coolers where after you release the button there's a short delay of dripping, this thing totally stops flow as soon as your finger leaves the button, which is great for reducing water spillage.The cooler has a hot and cold light indicator, when the light turns OFF, its ready, it also has an indicator light for when your water jug needs to be swapped out which is very nice so you're not having to open the door and check on a regular basis.Note that this thing has a radiator in the back of it, so to keep it functioning fully (especially if you have pets that shed really bad) make sure you're clearing the back grate often, and don't place it flush with a wall.I got this thing because I was alarmed a month or so ago by how much I was spending on water bottles every month, so far this thing is paying for itself.It looks good (I hate the tacky seeing the huge jug on the top loaded coolers) and stands roughly 4 feet tall (using my own height as a reference point here I have not actually measured it)What can I say, it works as advertised Dies in less than 2 months. This water dispenser worked great for just under 2 months. But now, just before the 2 month mark the pump has stopped pumping water. We can hear the pump try to pump but no water gets pulled up from the water bottle.  For what we paid for this, it should have lasted longer. It worked great until it didn't work at all. VERY FRUSTRATING. This was the second one I order the first one ... This was the second one I order the first one didn’t work for the cold.the second one Didn’t work at all!!!!!!!!! Easy to install full bottle of 5 gallon water I had two top loaded water dispenser before, loading the five gallon water bottle is always challenging for me. The main reason to buy bottom loaded dispenser is to solve the problem. So far so good, I like my purchase I liked the fact that is small and was easy to ... I liked the fact that is small and was easy to setup.  I didn’t like the fact it can with out the drain tray and can’t get one from the manufacturer Two Stars used it for one week, began to leak at the bottom. Returning now Not Worth It Product arrived with a dent where the door is for the bottom load. No idicator on the buttons for hot, room temp or cold dispensers. Definitely not worth it. Poor customer service on top of all that. Do not buy, better machines available from a better seller. Filters our AZ tap water beautifully! I only wish the cold water was colder ... Filters our AZ tap water beautifully! I only wish the cold water was colder and that you could actually fit a water bottle under the water dispenser. Five Stars Loved the style and the ease of loading the water bottles. Doesn’t work and no phone number to call. 2 problems made me return it back.  (1)No water came out after 4 hours.  (2) The water line did not connect securely.  Only went in a tiny bit.  We beveled it too but it never went all the way in.  Anyway,  the manual has no phone number to call about our problems.  Very odd.  It leaked after 4 hours from the water line. What a complete waste of time BE WARNED!!! This doesn't come with filters and you can't find them anywhere. What a complete waste of time. Easy to set up and load It works as advertised. Have not tried the hot water though. Downside is that you can hear it running, which can be aggravating even though it is basically quiet! Have now bought two. One as a gift and plan on sending another as a gift. LOVE that it bottom loads. Good product. I've had this product for almost 3 weeks so far so good. I love the easy access to hot water... Issue with room temp water, installation instruction and no filters sale on the market I like the product so far but there are 3 issues that I experienced. 1, no filter for sale in current market. I just realized after purchased and shipment. 2, poor installation and start up instructions. 3, there is not a continuous flow ambient water. I could have it only 1 cup and then no more flow. Stopped working It broke a couple of months after I got it. Even with a full container the red light comes on indicating that there is no water. Was working fine upto a week ago. Was thinking to send it back but even though there is one year warranty for this product Amazon tells me that the return window has already passed. The Ŵíndów seems to be a month long. I am going through contact the seller directly. Five Stars Good stuff. Best thing I've bought in a long time. Perfect product, we are very happy Perfect product , we are very happy! It’s a handsome dispenser, but returning. The hot water dispenser is no more than a trickle. It takes more than two minutes to get a 1/2 cup of hot water out. Tried emailing for help, but no response. Sending back for refund this week. First use tasted like plastic Working great! Cool, not cold The lower bottle position is very convenient. The motor draws the water easily. It occasionally hums a bit and the water is cool, not chilled. Not working good It is no good not working  properly I want to return Too pricey Not a good value for the money. Arrived damaged. I just received it today, but it seems to ... I just received it today, but it seems to be working well. If anything changes, I'll be sure to update. Hot water The water is plenty hot for my instant coffee in the morning. The coldest water is cold but not particularly Ice cold. There is three separate spouts and it is quiet. A little noise when it comes on but very tolerable. Love it, my husband can't stop raving about it! Works 10x better than the one we got from Menards. Very quiet and the pump doesn't try to work when there is no water left in the tank. It does leave a bit of water in the bottle but that's just fine with me. One Star Package came as damaged and the  dispenser had big dent & ding on it. Read the production description carefully. I like this water dispenser.  It is sleek looking, the cold water is cold and the hot, very hot.  Although the set-up directions are clear there is a little confusion about when exactly to turn on the power switches and when to prime the pump.Be careful reading the product description.  If, like me, you are looking for a dispenser that accommodates both 3 gallon and 5 gallon jugs, and that those jugs be readily interchangeable, you will be disappointed.  The dispenser is set up to take 5 gallon jugs. If you wish to use a 3 gallon jug then you have to cut the tube that goes into the jugs, which would then make it only useful for 3 gallon jugs. I was a little bit disappointed by this unexpected revelation. Easy to use and saves time This came in a big shipping box and within it had the main box with the water cooler. It was easy to unpack and setup. Only had to put drip tray in and get a full water bottle. Which you can get from any grocery store or Walmart or just get it delivered like I do,  Looks great! Fits in with my decor great. It took less than 5 minutes to cool and heat water. I like the 3 options it has for hot, cold and room temp water. Everything I need in my household for my water supply. We have well water and do not cook with it or drink. This #watercooler makes it so easy to make any hot drink. No waiting for the water to heat in the microwave or cool in the refrigerator for cold water. The room temp is nice to use for many of my cooking & baking needs. Which is one of my favorite this to do. It has to switches on the left side to turn off the heating or cooling of water, great energy saving feature. It is easy to move without a full water bottle and does not need a lot of room. Just make sure it has room to vent per manufacturers owners manual. Five Stars great and fast service. I like it, but.. I like it.. but I wish...#1  ... the fill area was a bit deeper.  My coffee cup is 3.5\" round,  the tray is 3\" deep.#2  .. that it came with Hot, Cold, Room, labels for the water dispensers.  The hot I have figured out, but I have to guess on the others ones.I like thats it's quiet, no vibration noise like the old water cooler, and no tank to pick up, and not much of a chance for a leak. Bought this as a gag gift to throw my husband ... Bought this as a gag gift to throw my husband off the scent of his real gift but had hopes of actually keeping it. He deciced he wouldn't use it so we returned it for a fee. It was still worth the $16 though. It was delivered promptly and in good condition and set up was easy We had another cooler by some other company but it went out in one year and was noisy. We bought the Brio and it is everything that they said it was. It was delivered promptly and in good condition and set up was easy. Had it working the same day and so far we have had no problems with it. Like the way it was engineered with the stainless steel tanks, and, it is quiet. Confusing orders! Look Those 3 buttons On the top, 3 lights in the middle and 3 water outlets! Guess which one is hot and which one is cold and which one is Rome temperature??? We found out buy trying many times.., actually I’m still not sure which one is colder.., Love the bottom loader Looks much better than the top loading water cooler and works perfect! Four Stars So far so good Works great! Just as expected. So far so good! Had it a couple weeks now and it works great! Really nice to have around and to save on bottles of water. Works just as expected. Now I hope we can get at least a few good years out of it! Five Stars I love this produt 0 Stars! If I could give it 0 stars, I would! This thing is a piece of crap. The labels and buttons are backwards. Cleaning it takes an hour and only last 3 days before the water starts tasting gross again and the machine will tell you that the bottle is almost empty, when the bottle is almost completely full. Definitely don't recommend. Huge bummer!!!!! Big time failure. I was very excited when this dispenser was delivered which was going to replace my old one for 3+ years as it had an extra feature of dispensing room temp water too.  I've installed it at 10:45 am this morning and loaded a 5 gal. Bottle. At about 10 PM, the reload indicator started blinking. I was shocked. I did not have a people over, there was only another person at home besides me and there is no way we can consume 5 gal. Of water in less than 12 hours. Neither does the dispenser has a 5 gal. Storage space in it. When I opened the bottle loading unit, I saw water dripping from sup above and the hot water was not being dispensed and neither was the room temp water. Where did the water go? Is still a mystery I'll have to unravel. I have initiated the product return and wouldn't recommend this to any. Hot is very hot, cold is pretty cold. Works great! The only thing that would make this better would be if there were some illumination for night trips to the water cooler. Hot is really hot, cold is pretty cold. Very pleased. damaged the item is damaged. The back piece of the item is bent, the door on the item is also bent, steering to the right. The door doesn't close properly due to the uneven structure and the top part of the door is open while the bottom is closed. Damaged/ dented Received the item slightly damaged. It takes away from an otherwise aesthetically pleasing design. It would be great to receive a new door to replace this one. Five Stars absolutely love it Best money spent Works perfectly and so quiet! Loading the water to the bottom is so much easier, than trying to lift a huge jug to the top. Best money spent. Doesn't work Doesn't work. We bought it for our business in December. We didn't open until February. In January, when we unpacked it, we couldn't get the hot water to heat. We kept trying to follow the manual. No luck. Now, it doesn't cool water either. I got too old to lift the 5 gallon bottles ... I got too old to lift the 5 gallon bottles tot he typical dispenser ..this sure makes it a breeze  changing te bottles !!! Looks great works great! So far this has been great! I wish it was a little taller. Water comes out cold and fast! Have not used any hot water yet but I am sure it works just fine. The pump does not work and the instruction manual is ... The pump does not work and  the instruction manual is poorly written and not clear. I am trying to find a way to return this I like it. It's clean looking I like it.  It's clean looking, and filters are easily accessible.  No more trips to the store for bottle water, and everyone in the family got there preference--HOT, COLD, or RT.  Thanks! Three Stars Hot water disspening button get stuck often. then a month later bought another because I was highly satisfied with the design and bang for the money Bought one unit,  then a month later bought another because I was highly satisfied with the design and bang for the money.  Haven't looked at replacement filters yet, hopefully they're not too expensive. One Star why would this product not come with the required filters. This one that we had for 2 months or less started dripping like crazy from the hot water side I ordered this cooler since our old cooler stopped working. Keep in mind we had it for 13 years. This one that we had for 2 months or less started dripping like crazy from the hot water side. I’m not talking a drop of water every few minutes. I’m talking about drops falling so fast it’s almost a steady leak. I love being able to just slide the water jug in ... I love being able to just slide the water jug in the bottom of this unit! Works beautifully and I find I am drinking a LOT more water! Definitely worth buying. NEEDS DRAIN HOOKUP - WASTES A TON OF WATER Directions were very poor.  You must have this item hooked up to a DRAIN as well as a water source.  We used a bucket to see if we could bypass but It was astounding how much water it wastes through the osmosis system.  It wasted over 10 gallons per day.  When you pay for your water that adds up quickly.  We tried to contact customer service and they never responded.  Also, the hoses and accessories were located inside the machine, which required a screwdriver to remove the back to access them.  This was never stated in the directions.  Would not recommend this product. Update: The company, organize.com, called me back two days after I called them and verified that in fact, for every gallon used, the cooler dumps 4 gallons to clean itself.  This cooler should be outlawed.  What a huge waste of water! Do not buy this. There are no replacement filters. I got screwed On this one. There are no replacenent filters. So, in three months when the filters just throw it away and buy a better product. Great Water dispenser Great find!  The hot water stays hot and the machine is quiet. We use a 5 gallon jug in about 3 days. Having good tasting water (we used to boil then filter our tap water) is such a good thing! I have nothing detracting to say about this purchase. Five Stars It seems to be a great product. The price was reasonable as well. Excellent product. Best thing about it is you don't ... Excellent product.  Best thing about it is you don't have to lift the bottle Five Stars This is beautiful and works amazing! and so far so good! The setup was very easy I received the water cooler about 2 weeks ago, and so far so good!  The setup was very easy.  The hot water works fantastic.  I am hoping it continues to do so.  So far, I am very happy with my purchase. Four Stars It’s good product....and it’s mineral water Reversed indicator lights Great water cooler, quiet, works perfectly, hot and cold temps are great. Reduced by one star because for some odd reason, the temperature indicators on the front are in the opposite order of the buttons that dispense water. I've had several friends come over and had to explain to them that hot water comes out under the snowflake. Simple little design flaw, not super significant, but certainly a head scratcher. Water Temperatures are PERFECT!! Arrived well packaged. Easy set up. Love it! Five Stars Great machine :) I love it Love the bottom- load Brio water dispenser! I really like my new water dispenser! Love the fact that I can load bottles by myself (I can’t lift more than 10#). It cools & heats very well. My only issue with it is the occasional hum/buzz/ vibrations, but then our floors aren’t great, so maybe that’s the problem. All fine All fine Stopped Powering Up @ Day 28 Adjusting rating.  The product worked wonderfully for a couple weeks. Then week three the motor was louder than normal. It is now not powering on at all.  The cooler has been positioned in the same place the entire time. I’m not sure what happened and I am just now getting to the one month mark.  Calling Brio to find out what’s wrong. Love this BRIO I absolutely love this! It's quiet (a huge plus) and delivers ice cold water, room temp and hot water hot enough fort tea. I  don't know how we ever got on without it. I would recommend this to anyone who uses bottled water! the unit is ok on cooling and heating, my ... the unit is ok on cooling and heating,my complaint is that is very noisy, i have it in the kitchen, by night i ear the noise from the compresor in my bedroom. Best purchase ever Very sleek looking. Best purchase ever! Easy to hook up. Okay cut Room temperature button is ice cold; which defeats the purpose of 3 buttons I am very happy with the design and quality of my new Brio ... I am very happy with the design and quality of my new Brio bottom loading water dispenser. It is quiet, easy to load and the water temperatures are perfect. Damaged Item came damaged shipping box not damaged unhappy! Cabinet Door DOES NOT open Very nice,  I thought the stainless part was a cabinet but it is not, that is one of the two things I would change, in the description it says stainless steel cabinet door, which to me means you can open it but this is not the case.  The drip tray is plastic, I would of liked it to be stainless. Other than that performance is great, keeps water nice and cold. Looks great, room temp is cold and a but slow ... Looks great,  room temp is cold and a but slow but over all happy with it. Four Stars everything very well is working perfect  thanks. Five Stars Great water cooler/heater Great for kids and elderly! No need to assemble or making that force to put the water on top, very easy and going for use! Do I really need  hot water didn't think I would use the hot water very much, But its perfect for cup of ramen soup, instant coffee , cup of hot coco, its a lot faster then my Keurig brewer. Easy to replace the water myself Works well in our small office. The hot water makes a little noise when it comes out, but otherwise the unit is totally quiet. Cold water is cold. Easy to replace the water myself. Much easier than pugging a heavy water bottle up. Happy with the purchase. Wish it were a less expensive but if it lasts 10 years like our last unit then I'll be satisfied. Damaged The product arrived damaged The shipping box was fine, but the stainless steel front of the cooler ... I received this unit just today. The shipping box was fine, but the stainless steel front of the cooler has dents all along it. It looks terrible! It looks like someone has kicked it. I am returning it. The unit works fine, but looks awful. I don't want it in my house, especially at this price. Five Stars Great water cooler  quiet and ofisent Great tasting water, but not very clear installation instructions. Installation directions are not very clear.  You must install the the drain tube to a drain or at least put the hose up into the sink when you clean over night (I drilled a hole to the outside and let it spray out there into the bushes).  It's also a pain trying to understand how you are suppsoed to flush the filters before installing them.  The water is excellent, taste is near perfect.  I still can't purchase filters for it yet.  So, I wouldn't purchase this until they clearly sell filters.  They say it will be in June, but if they end up not carrying or selling them, the unit will be useless. Quietly saving money Works great we should have done this sooner, money saver and the hot works as well as the microwave.....very good investment. Recommended. Arrived cracked but I didn't want to go through the trouble of packing it up and waiting for another. Pumps up water very quietly compared to my previous unit. Keeps water very cold and hot efficiently. Recommended. Hot water works great, but no cold so I submitted a return ... Received today and set up only to find that after 6 hours there is no cold water. Hot water works great, but no cold so I submitted a return request. However, after reading several reviews I found that there is a button inside the door on the upper left hand corner that supposedly re-sets the cold unit when you change a bottle. Thus telling the unit is has enough water to start the compressor for cold water. I'll try this and see if it works. TBC...also everyone is right about the icons, they are backwards and VERY confusing! Ok that did not work, still no cold water so returning. Works great, attractive and a good value Works great, attractive and a good value. This replaced a water cooler we had for about 10 years (GE brand) and I shopped around some. This is a well-made product, water flow is very good, cools the water quite well and even has an in-between setting for \"cool\", not cold, water. I enjoy drinking water and now with this in my house I will continue to drink more water. Plus this will get my wife and kids to start drinking more water. Well worth the money. Hot water supply stopped working I purchsed this in late July, in late October the hot water element on the machine stopped working. I am extremely dissatisfied with this machine. Don't buy this product !!!!! Only worked for a couple of months then just stopped working. The hot water spout serves perfect temperature water for making tea or instant oatmeal It works amazingly. The hot water spout serves perfect temperature water for making tea or instant oatmeal. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, especially for the price. If you are researching water dispensers you will know that there are not any for such a reasonable price. And with this inexpensive model you are not sacrificing quality at all. ... and this one has to be one of the better one's i have seen on the internet I did quite a bit of reading looking for a quality water dispenser and this one has to be one of the better one's i have seen on the internet. I have saved so much on not having to buy bottled water anymore since having this and its nice to be able to get hot water with a flick of a switch. Love the bottom loading feature and the water flow is way better than on our old one. Highly recommend! Ok Love it I purchased this water cooler because I didn't like the taste of my tap water and individual bottles ... I purchased this water cooler because I didn't like the taste of my tap water and individual bottles of water were inconvenient. My dispenser delivers cold water quite fast and the amount of time it takes to chill the water is quick too. Now when the family comes over for a get together everyone drinks my water! Overall, I'm very pleased with my dispenser and recommend it to all my friends! Well made, feels solid, and looks attractive. I would highly recommend this to anyone that needs a cooler. It sucks It sucksit sucks Don't buy this First it's really light and seems flimsy. Second, it has three buttons that are not labeled so I had to add my own for customers. Third the room temperature and cold water button both came out cold. Then after only 2-3 months of having it the machine stopped working. I reached out to the company and they sent me a trouble shoot PDF, which I followed but still didn't fix the problem. I followed up with the company again to see if I can get a replacement or something and never got a reply back. it does not pump after a few months I bought this product 4 times in total.  First 2 works perfectly so far.  The 3rd stop pumping water in 1 month and returned.  The 4th has stopped pumping water too, after 3 months. Perfect This is a must for our house and it has worked flawlessly! Cold hot or room temp all the time. Glad I got it! Good product. I bought this one to replace one I gave to my son when he moved out. It is a quality product and I have had zero issues with it. Doesn't last! Absolute garbage! The board burned out just over a year! Of course, after warranty! Disappointed The worst thing I ever bought. The same day I open it was a nightmare. The water will drained by itself. I had to throw it away since I took so long to return it. Waste of money Reduced footprint with this awesome way to get cold filtered water. Stainless steel sleek/polished looks fine in the dining room. Stopped working completely in less than 6 months Since purchase, the room temperature water doesn’t work. Both cold and room temperature  comes out cold.The past month or so now, the light blinks like it is empty and won’t dispense. However, it’s not empty. It’s glitching and now and useless. We’ve had the unit for 5 months or less. Feel like we wasted our money sadly. One Star Unit arrived dented Good for price Great! Only problem is the middle button sometimes sticks so don’t press down too hard Customer service number please ? I bought this may of 2018 and for last two months the refill light is always flashing when it have just replaced the bottle ... I also can not find Customers service number online ... This cooler started buzzing loudly after only a month This cooler started buzzing loudly after only a month.  If you do decide to buy this junk, I advise that you save the box. I couldn't return it because I didn't save the box Works well Works as expected but would like an economy setting to avoid constant heating and cooling costs Don’t buy Bought this cooler 6 months ago and it has already stopped working.  It wont suck the water into the container.  Would not recommend buying this item. Not a good product I bought mine in July, it's stopped working, so disappointed about the product. I guess I will trash it, it's of no use. Broken after 3 months! Broken after only 3 months.  Only cold water comes out of all three slots now.  Enjoyed having three options when all were working.  If I only wanted cold water it would be a 5 star product.  I will call about receiving a replacement & post an update. Would like a replacement Purchased in March of this year and it no longer works. Light keeps flashing red to replace bottle. It seems like the pump had malfunctioned. Not happy at all Really easy and nice!!! Amazing! It looks great. My unit stoped working after only 5 days would not buy! GARBAGE Garbage... Lasted 8 months then leak all over the floor bad seals complete garbage Terrific unit for the price After returning a different unit this Brio was a great replacement.  The unit functions well, is easy to refill, and has worked nicely for us.  It is a bit noisy when refilling the hot or cold water but it only lasts for a few seconds. Looks great in my kitchen with the rest of my stainless ... Looks great in my kitchen with the rest of my stainless steel appliances. although I have to give it 2 stars due to the quality. 2 major things wrong with this product:1) The dispense buttons are confusing/misleading. There are 3 dispensers, the cold water dispenser is on the far right although a picture/icon of a snowflake (for cold water?) is shown on the far left and where the cold water is there is an icon of 2 rectangles? In the middle of the snowflake and rectangles is the sign for hot water which is little flames although the hot water dispenser is actually where the snowflake icon is shown. Not sure if it was just my item or Brio makes their product item all this way but it was upsetting at first, now we are used where the dispensers are.2) The sensor seems to be off from the start. .  after putting in a new 5 gallon and it not being half way empty the sensor will turn red which is signaling us that we are low on water and the machine automatically turns off the cooling setting although still being plugged into outlet. We have to open the bottom and reset the button so the cooling (cold water) is available again.We needed a dispenser that fit our family's lifestyle (look and needs wise) which this half way met our expectations, we are always on the go so I would have returned it but I threw away the box and really don't have the time as it functions but not to the quality it is sold for. If you are looking for looks then sure buy the product but I would not buy again and will be investing in another dispenser when this one stops functioning completely. So smooth and quiet I (foolishly) rented a machine for years, and it was loud and the water came out slowly. This machine is is smooth, quiet, gravity-fed, and has a spike (which, if you have delivery service, means the water doesn't poor out when you flip the bottle over). My only improvements/suggestions would be to (1) add a little LED light to the dispensing area, (2) make the distance between the spouts and the drip tray larger to accommodate water bottles and such, and (3) to place symbols on the buttons to indicate which is hot and tepid (the hot is, I suppose, rather obvious). To be clear, those are NOT complaints. I'm really quite happy with this machine. Lasted a little over 3 months Seems like the motor stopped working and pumping water up. Our second unit is now dead. The first one we exchanged because of loud vibrations from the cooling unit. This one is doing the same, but in addition, it's now broken because it's leaking water out of the top of the unit. Stylish, clean look and function Ive had it for just over a week, and so far am pleased with it overall.  Only nitpicks are in some of its design.  Why the lights for cold and hot are not set up in line with the actual hot and cold spouts is perplexing (they’re opposite). There’s no indicator on the buttons to tell which is cold and which is neutral (which pours fairly cold itself). And finally, the tray holes do not line up with the water, so it splatters on the plastic. Never ever will I own this again I bought Brio Essential Series Bottom Load Hot, Cold & Room Water Cooler Dispenser. Within a month it broke down. When we loaded the dispenser  it went into this constant loop trying to pump the water into the hot and cold water chambers. It fails to pump the water and it show flashing red light to indicate an issue. I contacted customer service they gladly sent me a replacement. 3 months into the replacement item, it run into the same problem. I don't use it heavily, it runs through a 5-gallon water tank a week. In my office the water cooler goes through multiple 5-gallon a day. If this is going to a three month stint, it is not worth it. I will ask for my money back, not sure how that fight will go. I won't own this piece any longer. Stopped Working After 3 Months After three months in my office, with light useage .. it just quit working. No longer will dispense water? Best investment you can make Packed very nicely no damage. Hard time with understanding the instructions but once you figure out what you are doing its a breeze and you will never go back to bottled water again.Thinking on buying a second unit for my garage. Got this as a gift. Got this as a gift because of the issues with the water in our town.  Worked fine for a few months but the last jug of water we put on, it started leaking. We immediately took the jug off and made sure that everything was in place and the plastic ring on the top was secure. Yep. So we put the new jug back on and watched it for a bit.  All was well so we went to bed. Got up the next morning and it had all leaked out over night. The entire 5 gallons had leaked out and ran under our new laminate hard wood floors.  I emailed the company and they were very fast at responding to me and emailed us a shipping label to send it back. They have already shipped us out a new one and a bottom load instead of a top load. Best buy of the year Water is cold and fresh tasting the kids are able to make there own drinks and very easy to setup and use way better thank buying bottles of water. Stopped working after 2 months and company won't return calls Indicator light says \"empty\" when connected to a full bottle of water, will no longer dispense.  Have only had this since mid-late July.  Company won't return calls to fix it as it is under warranty. I love this cooler however am I the only one that ... I love this cooler however am I the only one that has an issue with the pictures of the water temp being backwards?  Not one review mentions it. Left side button with red switch shows cold water.  Middles button below picture shows hot. Right button shows room temp. I’m confused. Which is which? Extremely disappointed! It only lasted me 2 months! It just stopped working. Extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with the product and it’s sellers. I can’t even get a refund !! Failing product Hot water button is sticking after 1.5 months.  Don’t buy I love the unit I love the unit, It is very nice looking! The hot water works fine! But the Cold Water is no Colder then the room Temperature nozzle is! It really up sets me because I really like it and hate the trouble of sending it back! Stopped working after a few months randomly stopped working. customer service refuses to answer.Don't buy Warning!!! After just 3 months, and no warning, my water dispenser just stopped working. The hot water is cold. And now the red light wont turn to green after changing the water bottle. One Star Leaked. Had to return. This broke after one month! Very disappointing. Dispenser broke after one month. Will try contacting company for replacement. Highly recommend Aesthetically appealing. Functional. Quality appliance. Dented jug We would like a new 5 gallon water jug sent to us, free of charge. One of the original two that we purchased arrived to our home dented with a large depression on the bottom side, however, we did not think it would effect the functionality of the jug, so we decided to use it without returning it. After several times of filling it up, we left home one day only to return home to find water leaking everywhere on the floor because the jug had ultimately formed a crack. This mishap not only flooded our kitchen, but also the internal wiring of our $200 water dispenser, rendering it unusable. Please send us a new jug, without any dents. Looking to hear back soon. Not a good buy I bought this product last month it was working g fine and now two days ago it stopped working. I contacted the retailer and I am waiting to see if they respond and give me the warranty to fix or replace it. Until then this will be my review for the product. HORRIBLE, STOPPED WORKING AFTER 3 MONTHS worked great for 3 month and then after the pump does not work. I looked at all the youtube tutorials on how to fix but still broken. I cannot find any website to contact customer support for Brio on google.  complete waste of money Water all over the floor We bought one of these and It would not turn on, so we sent to back and got another.The second one worked fine for a few weeks. then one day we came to the office and found 4 gallons of water on the floor ! not sure what happened but something within the \"guts\" of the unit gave out. and now I have a huge mess on my hands. Had to replace the flooring, and base boards. Very expensive problem. I'm not at all happy with this purchase.and I have to buy a new water cooler! LED Display Incorrect PLUS NO Ambient Water! LED Display INCORRECT!!!! Cold Water indicator light is above the hot water nozel. Hot water indicator light is above Ice Cold Water. There is an indicator light in the middle position, but it dispenses Ice cold water!!! I had to pay to carry it into my office so it will cost more to return than to live with the problem, but if the water fairy would deliver me a new one I will gladly give them this one! Hot water dispenser broken after 6 months It started off like a good purchase, but just 6 months after we bought it, the hot water dispenser just dispenses water that is cold and yellow. We barely used the unit, and I already have to buy a new one. Not happy at all. Do not buy this product. Not working and only bought in April.  No customer service number to call. Doesn’t work Stopped working in two months.  Improperly labeled.  Very good until it just suddenly stopped working. Will never buy this product again It’s super loud ... only chilled water for about 2 months before becoming defective. No longer works to chill water Not working at all Both hot and cold water didn't work at all. Lights were not on and only room temperature water came out. Not worth of the time and effort to unpack, install, return, pack and ship back. Impressed The heating and cooling features are great.  Excellent product. Don’t buy Terrible product leaks everywhere No more overflowing recycling in this house. We go through a lot of bottled water.  We were disgusted by all of our weekly recycling.  We needed a change !We did not want a bottle sitting outside of the unit, and we wanted both hot and cold options.  We also wanted something that was ecstatically nice to look at since we would keep it in the kitchen.  The Brio Essential Series Bottom Load fit met my requirements and was recommended on Prime.  We love it!  The ability to get cold, hot, and room temp water is terrific. The exchange of the bottle in the bottom load is quick and simple.  It is quiet !  We no longer have young children, but the safety button for hot water would be something a family might like.Setup - Simple.  I thought managing the 5 gallon water bottles would be a pain - it is not.  I am still not sure what we will do strategically about on-demand purchase or delivery of the 5 gallon water, but I think we will evaluate that after a month or two.  It's pretty easy to get them in our local grocery store.I would make some small changes and I added a few of these myself.  1.  I put a small white dot on the outside of the unit under each spout.  This way you don't have to always look down and under to make sure your water bottle is under the spout ( avoid spill ).  2.  And this might be a more where we have our unit.  There is not a lot of light, so I added a small battery operated sensor light, so when I put my bottle near the unit the light comes on and I can see the fill point.  3.  I would have more room to sit a reusable water bottle.  Yes, you can remove the catch tray to get more room but that is just tedious.  I tip my bottle and that works ( and the reason for recommendation 1 ).  I did mark 5 stars for value for the money.  I have never owned another unit to compare, but this seems like a good quality unit, so I didn't mind paying what I did.It's been a few weeks and our recycling has dropped dramatically.  A little less plastic in the world is a good thing. Very good Some noise like a refri Unhappy The cold water is not cold at all.....Very dissatisfied Five Stars Works perfect! No complaints not well made looks cheap and is cheap stopped working after 5 months of normal usage would not recommend to purchase DON\"T WASTE YOUR $$ quit working after a few months and no way to return it! was great for 2 months- now broke We loved our cooler for 2 months, even though it is really loud. Now the red refill light is staying  on and it won't suck up water.  Not happy at this point with our purchase :-( I am so satisfied with this purchase I am so satisfied with this purchase. I researched so many water dispensers to try and find the best deal, I finally decided on Brio because it's a brand I've learned to trust. The cold water is very cold and dispenses quickly. The hot water temp is perfect for hot chocolate and even tea. There is a switch in back that turns the hot water off if you don't want to use it. The child safety mechanism on the hot water side is very adult friendly but would be very effective at preventing burns to children. The product arrived in a timely manner in good condition. Set up was very easy. I happy my worries were unfounded and I'm extremely happy with ... I didn't want the old-fashioned upside-down water cooler for my office, so I took a chance on this, but worried in the back of my head that the mechanism that draws the water up would be cheap and it wouldn't last. I happy my worries were unfounded and I'm extremely happy with the purchase. The mechanism that draws the water up is a sturdy long straw that goes to the bottom of the water container and clamps securely to the top of the container. The unit is durable (I accidentally slammed a desk into it while I was moving and absolutely nothing happened to the unit). The cooler is also stylish, quiet, and cranks out ice cold water and hot water in short order. Initial setup takes maybe 3 minutes. I would recommend this product to anyone.PROS:1) Nice looking and extremely simple to use.2) Love the fact the container is hidden.2) Hot water is hot enough to make tea and hot chocolate.3) Empty bottle indicator4) Not noisy5) water flow is way better than on our old one.CONS: No cons This is the best water dispenser that I have come around for my ... This is the best water dispenser that I have come around for my money. I had several water dispensers over the past several years and had not seen a more practical one. This water dispenser has never fail on providing cold or hot water when needed. I really like the feature of the empty bottle indicator, when the red light starts flashing I know the bottle is empty and needs to be changed. I am very satisfied with this water dispenser and hope I don't have to buy another for a long time. Works great! I will recommend this cooler to others. Thanks Brio. Looks great, hot and cold temps both perfect Love this! Especially love the hot feature for my tea and oatmeal love not needing my hubby to load the heavy water up on top like our older model. Warning! Short water pump/sensor life This unit was working fine for about 4 months than began showing signs of pump failure. Now the unit continually indicates an empty bottle even with a full bottle installed. Please reach out to me Brio! Stopped working in less than 5 months. Not good. Received brio water cooler on June 11, 2018 and now on Oct 30, 2018 it stopped working. I refilled the 5 gallon bottle yesterday, inserted probe, and now none of the 3 valves pour any water. Water cooler makes noise after closing bottom door but that's it. Unplugged unit, turned off cold and hot switches. Didnt help. No water pours.  All it does is flash a red icon. Very disappointed. Would like a refund or option for a different model. Five Stars Works fantastic and we are quite pleased Five Stars wasn't well package..but product was perfect Not long lasting We received this as a gift for our anniversary end of July and about a week ago the replace bottle sign came on. We have tried everything! I got On here and found similar reviews! Loved it while it lasted, but I’d find a different brand if I were You! BUY ONE TODAY! Our prior machine started leaking so I had to replace it and wanted to give this a try based on all the bells and whistles in the description and boy, did it deliver.  The ease of use and the ability to have INSTANT hot water and a choice of room temperature or cold drinking water makes it a thousand times better than expected.  It is so simple to put the water in without having to lift heavy bottles.  If you're in the market for a new water cooler you can stop looking and order this one NOW! Happy with purchase! Product has worked great for several months with no complaints! Does not leak, hot/cold water works efficiently, love the child safety for hot water. Happy with purchase! Work as intended small reservoir Don’t Buy Terrible. Would definitely not recommend. Stop working after 2 weeks. I’ve tried everything possible to get it to work. Very disappointed. Bad quality product Broke in 20 days of purchase Keeps water cold Keeps water cold. Easy to use Nothing but trouble The first one came in busted, so we returned it.  The 2nd came in, intact, however, we've had nothing but trouble with it having good suction.  It constantly tells us the water bottle is empty, when it's not, and we have to finesse it multiple times before it'll accept the new water bottle.  Overall just a junky product.  Unfortunately we are now out of our return timeframe for a defective item. Grear dispenser This dispenser has a nice small footprint and looks good as well. I like the fact that I don't need to lift the bottles, I just slide them in. I'm very happy with it. Not happy with the purchase Bought in June 2018 and stopped working after 3 months. Very frustrating with the noise levels. Expensive but not reliable if broke in such a short period Very difficult to install Had to hire a plumber to install.  He had difficulty figuring out the drain.  I looked on You Tube.  Only found an advertisement for this water cooler.  No \"how to\".  I ordered something to hook up to the water faucet so I didn't have to carry water back and forth.  I thought this would fit the bill.  Called (there is no number on the user's Manual.) Downtown Wholesalers is listed on the very bottom of the last page.  No other contact information (e-mail, telephone number, fax, address, etc).  The young man that answered told me if my plumber couldn't figure it out then I needed a new plumber.  This plumber re-piped my whole house but this thing stumped him.  Then this young man offered to send me a \"detailed\" manual of how to install it.  It was the very same manual it came with the water cooler.No phone numbers and only a name to contact on the very bottom of the last page of the User's Manual..  Repairs and After Sales Service gives you no information for contacting the company.  All this makes it difficult to follow through if you have questions.I most certainly will not order again. Awesome! Returned a different brand that I purschased elsewhere because rhe cold water was not cold. This model has ice cold water and the hot water is very hot. Love it! Push buttons are an ease to use. Have it in my kitchen. Don't waste your money It broke after only having it for 3 weeks. Safety design for house with children. Works às expected.  Great design when children around. Lock on hot button but also shut-off switchs high on side of machine  (out of sight), for hot and cold power.  Very happy, and price great . Pump stopped working Purchased 6 July, inoperable 10 September.  Will follow up with Amazon and Brio.Pump does not pull water from full 5 gallon bottle, found water on floor around unit. Its ok Regularly shuts off on its own even when its own but it does keep water cold and hot.  Not really worth the price they charge for it.  Additionallly the hose inside regularly because unsecure.  I spent four hours trying to get the water to suction finally checked all the connections and found that the connection to the pump itself comes off. Smoke on the Water Purchased in June 2018 smoke started pouring out of the back of the machine on Sept 9th. 2018. Great product! A little noisy but good product. Makes a little too much noise, but it works. Junk Worked great for one month then motor/pump stopped functioning. Absolutely ridiculous and inconvenient that I now need to return and replace item after less than 45 days of use. Garbage! Crap!! The hot water button sticks - not good for a waiting room where everyone burns the crap out of themselves. now we keep the hot water button off - which defeats the whole purpose of buying it . :( Hard to find filters replacement Great machine love it. Red refill light continuously flashing Red refill light keeps flashing no matter what I do. Only had this unit since June 2018. Good Product Works well. My office employees use it a lot. One Star The water is not too cold,Was expecting  more coldest Five Stars Works very well, not noisy st all, cold water cold, hot water hot Nice Cooler Its a nice cooler. I do wish it was a little colder.  I havent had a chance to use the hot water side yet. Super cold water works great! Read The Negative Reviews Before Purchasing - Most are consistently the same I bought this product in March of 2018. Worked nicely for six months. Now the red light indicating “change bottle” constantly blinks and won’t pump water. It acts like the water pump can’t gain a suction. Very disappointed. $250 down the drain. Five Stars Very good. Meets my expectations. DO NOT PURCHASE! NOT A GOOD PRODUCT!!! Do not get this water dispenser! It  broke down after just 3 months (I purchased this in May) We have been trying to contact Brio with no successful response for a replacement or our money back the last few weeks. It never really provided cold water and the buttons started getting stuck days before it stopped despising water. Worst product and customer service for a product ever! If I could rate this a 0 I would! Great product. Great for the home. Top notch Water cooler Excellent product. Easy to install and use. Decent price for good water unit. Not sure what other reviewers are saying about unit being noisy. Not an issue here. All good for the last month plus. Good unit. The only feature I wish this had ... Good unit.  The only feature I wish this had was illumination around the area where the water is dispensed.  It is difficult to see at night. Fantastic Love this product! Excellent Cooler! this machine has been great! very quiet - easy to use (basically unpack and plug in). No problems! Not recommended, Cold water doesn't work Was really hoping this would a great product, despite the reviews on saying that the cold water did not work or this and that. But I was wrong. The hot water worked but the cold never got cold. I contacted the seller and their response was that I had to contact amazon because it was fulfilled by amazon. So, I did and I returned the dispenser. Which amazon was very easy to work with on doing so.Had to go buy another one but instead of ordering on amazon, like we do everything else, we went to Lowes and got one. Not as pretty as this one, but it has \"really\" cold water, which is very nice. So suffice to say, I do NOT recommend this product what so ever. Great product!! I like it, my family likes it. Works great!! Good product. Poor instructions. I think this is a great product but once you figure out the procedure it's very simple to install. Product came quick.I didn't realize it that the filters were in the top part of the box. Since these boxes are made to be lifted from the top and the filters are so light I did not realize they were above the top Styrofoam till later. I wasn't sure they were included till much later :( But in that process I realized after searching online that the filters for replacement are yet not available. Another issue I felt was the lack of clear instructions.My issue was that it was a commercial setup and not the usual plastic plumping, otherwise it would have been a breeze for the setup (Definitely easier than the other RO units).One other small issue is the inlet hook up is not the push in type connection and I felt that connector could be replaced with a better one.The water quality is awesome with TDS in the teens for us. It tastes great and I love this unit. I just hope they can come up with cheap filters for it soon.I think the product will get 5 stars once they resolve the above issues. Five Stars Great heavy duty cooling coil, looks great and will pay for it's self in a year from leasing one! Amazing water cooler! It’s awesome! Im getting too old to lift a 5 gallon water bottles. Now I open the door and slide the jug in and put the cap on. I wish I would have gotten this sooner. Could be colder Works great, looks good. The cold water could be a little colder but overall happy with purchase Awesome stainless look Awesome Stainless look product looks great! Product has very cold water and it's not noisy at all! Recommend for the kitchen I purchased 4 coolers from this company all great! 1 for kitchen 1 for garage 1 for office and 1 as a gift!! VERY HAPPY LOVE BRIO I purhased this for my office my employees love it! Great cold water, big space for sports bottle! Conviniant bottom load! And very nice stainless look like the top load version! I purhased the top load for my kitchen Cord is damaged internally and stops going cold randomly It took me awhile to figure out why it stops behaving properly but the cord is short circuiting and has been since I set it up a week after I bought it Quiet, fast, high quality Best water dispenser ever.-Automatic pump is very, very quiet-Chiller nearly silent, and keeps water very cold-Flow rate for dispensing is much higher than other dispensers-Loading/unloading bottles is quick and painless-Pleasant aesthetics, subdued logosThe only improvement I can think of is that they could increase the space under the nozzles so that you could fill larger sized water bottles. Have not seen a water dispenser that has feature yet. Very nice unit We really like how easy it is to load the water bottles. We also really like the 3 different water temps. Not worth it. Man, this thing was great for five months. In the last two weeks though, it constantly shuts off and flashes error lights. We basically have to slam the door on the water compartment closed 10-25 times a day to reset. To be fair I have a toddler but the most he does is steal the spill tray to play with. This thing is fully wack and annoying at this point.I haven't read any reviews with this issue but I'm not in the habit of reading reviews of items I've already bought; I do that before. This thing pooped the bed an astronomical 23 times today so we're going to email the company tomorrow to look for a fix but, being proactive, I'd say save your money. Five months functional isn't worth the price. Not Hot or Cold enough I owned a similar water cooler before purchasing this new one, so I can give an honest comparison. The unit itself is very attractive but lacks a few of the more important items; like a LED night light so you can see where the water is pouring out of (There are times where I miss the water and it ends up pouring on my hand)! The only other thing I was disappointed in was that the cold water is not chilled cold water and the hot water is not steaming hot. Both of which I had on my previous OLD model! I don't know if there is a way to adjust the settings but overall I was a little disappointed. I have to place my hot water from the water cooler, in the microwave to get the water to steam hot for a cup of coffee or tea. I also have to add ice cubes to my glass of water for a \"Chilled\" cold glass of water. Hopefully, the next upgrade will have a light feature and adjustable settings for the waters. Works well met our expectations Does the job heats cools and easy to load as bottom loaded. (5 gallon bottles are heavy) It stopped working practically new Not good bearly bought it in July only 2 months old and it stopped working it keeps lighting empty bottle and its full it won't pick up water Disappointed purchase I’ve used Brio before and had no issues. I was disappointed that it worked for one day and the next day the cooking didn’t work. My water was luke warm. I am returning it and bought a Hamilton beach for cheaper price and works much better n/a Mine stopped dispensing water after 8 months. The red light keeps flashing n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Broke on receipt\" The door hinge was broken when i received it. It was not shipping damage. I think it was a prevoiusly returned item. It was very irritating to get a new item that was broken. It was then hard to get it back in the box. I returned for a refund because the plastic hinge is not a good idea on a bottom loading water dispenser. \"LEAKS LIKE THE OTHERS - but it's an easy fix.\" I buy water in 5 gallon glass jugs that costs $4/gal. So, when reading reviews that various Primo water dispensers have a tendency to leak, I watched mine like a hawk. The water is too expensive to let it go to waste AND I just redid my kitchen floor. Lo and behold, I came home about 4 weeks after purchasing it and there was a puddle on the ground in front of it. I took the casing apart and figured out where the leak was coming from - and why it was happening.The water gets heated in a round metal cylinder covered in Styrofoam. This container sits right at the top center of the parts section and has a cheapo plastic lid that has NO WAY to keep it in place other than the little gripper rings on the side of the lid. In other words, there is no latch or band and it doesn't screw on. As the water heats, the plastic gripper rings start to distort/stretch/etc and they will no longer keep the lid sealed. The lid starts to leak heat (and water) which only makes the problem worse and results in a dispense/heat/leak cycle that is never ending. How you fix it is that you have one person with some impressive upper body strength hold the plastic lid on the cylinder so that it is sealed on all sides. This is harder than it sounds once it gets misshapen. You should have no problems, though, if you do this as soon as you get the item home. Then, you simply duct tape the ever-loving mess out of the lid, securing it tightly to the cylinder. I chose to take thin tape strips and place them in a star pattern across the top, taping the ends to the Styrofoam covering. This has been working well. Do not make the tails on the tape ends too short. They need to wrap fully over the lid and stretch several inches down the cylinder. Do yourself a favor and do this sooner rather than later. This thing WILL leak on you. It is just a matter of time. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Primo water dispenser works great\" Switched from a top load to a bottom load water dispenser. Much quieter and much easier to load. The only draw back so far is that the warning light comes on when water needs changing...doesn't empty the bottle completely. But I just pour the left over amount into a pitcher to put in fridge. \"Don't Waste Any More $$ On A Rental!\" We purchased this unit in September 2015 and have had absolutely no problems. We spent over $700 the past few years renting a cooler from Kentwood. The bottom-loading feature is sweet. I no longer have to wait for my husband to hoist the heavy bottle onto the top of the cooler - I can just slide it in. The hot water is HOT. I use a percolator on the stove for my coffee. It used to take about 15 minutes for the water to boil. When I fill it up with the hot water, it's only about 4-5 minutes. I find that using the push tab to dispense the water is easier than the old hold-down spigot. I don't find it noisy at all. Every once in a while it will rattle and hum, but that's probably due to it not being perfectly level. All in all an excellent purchase and no more rental fees! \"Water cooler\" Very easy to setup and use. Works well with our kitchen setting. Would highly recommend this item to friends and family. \"Great so far\" So far so good. Very quiet & no taste added to water. Can't complain about anything do far. \"Pros and cons\" Easier than lifting and putting water on a top loader is a pro. Con is that the water doesn't seem as cold as a top loader. Four stars due to relief on my back! \"Plug in and use! Easy!\" Water dispenser arrived on time and well packed! Plugged in and loaded water below, started right away and works like a charm! \"This water dispenser is great.\" This water dispenser is nice and style. It matches my stainless appliances. It's awesome not have the large blue water tank at the top and easier to change now.The hot water locking feature is excellent for safety reasons. I glad I purchased this item. \"Not pumping water into the above bottle tank\" I bought this cooler 1 1/2 years ago. It worked fine until recently. Now it does not pump water from the bottom of the bottle under the unit to the top tank. I have tried to reseal the cap on the bottle a dozen times, but no use now. Looking to replace with old style gravity flow type. \"Primo Water Cooler\" I had a Primo Water cooler previously and was very pleased with it therefore, I chose a Primo this time around. The bottom loading is very convenient additionally, the hot water feature if great for instant cereals and hot tea. Very pleased. \"Did not work\" I follow the instruction, the unit connected for 24 hours and did not cool the water.It will be returned today \"We've had this cooler for a few months and love it\" It's easy to load the cooler especially for ladies, not having to lift those big bottles of water to put on top, all you do is just slip it in the bottom. \"Great Cooler\" Great cooler. It's a little noisy when you first plug it in. We found that it quieted down once we leveled out the cooler with a little bit of cardboard. There is a little bit of water left in the bottom of the bottle but this is an issue with all pump coolers. I've used a few different brands of the bottom load coolers and there is always a little bit of water left. I just dump it in my coffee pot reservoir so I don't waste the water. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Almost Perfect\" We purchase this water dispenser to replace one that fed from atop which stopped working. In shortwe love it BUT it only has a cold and hot option not median temp. For the price it should have come with a room temperature option. But again we love it, it just isn't right that their top tier doesn't come with it. n/a Just bought it. Water cold and hot.. love it!!! I bought another one a month ago and I'm taking it back... \"Water cooler\" We like the water cooler but have only had it a couple weeks which is why only a 4 rating. I will review again after a while. I've never had a water cooler and wish it had an easier way to fill a coffee pot/larger container \"Loud, and get the extended warranty\" Bought this to replace 20 month old previous purchase of same model. Get the extended warranty. Hot water started leaking like many other reviews. This one seems louder than last one. Really like bottom load. Nice appearance. Cleaning isn't too much trouble; so, didn't think self cleaning models worth the expense. \"Excellent Water Cooler\" I've read the reviews before deciding to purchase this unit. With some of the review in mind, here are my comments:PRO:Quite Operation. The first few days it was VERY quite. But thereafter it is only slightly louder. Not loud enough to interrupt a conversation - it is quiet as other coolers family members own.Ease of use: It is very easy to change out water and to operate in general.Night Light: The night light helps when you got to have a drink in the middle of the night.CON:No way to lock the cool water - it only has a lock for the hot. I've had little ones press the cold water and had to clean up the resulting mess. [There IS a blue button that APPEARS to be a lock button but it is non-functional.]OVERALL:Very satisfied with the purchase \"Got home, front door was dented\" Open the box before you drive away, would've saved me another trip. Some cushioning at this area in the box would've prevented this. Looked ok, but never got to try it \"4 years\" I purchased this dispenser in the spring of 2014. About a week ago, the cold water started leaking. Yesterday, I put a new 5-gallon in it. Today, it doesn't sense the refill and the water isn't being heated or cooled. I'm completely impressed with the quality appliance I bought from Primo. I will never buy from them again. \"Easy to use\" This dispenser is easy to use and works very well. I wish it was a little quieter, but I am sensitive to sound so it could be just me. \"Good concept, bad design\" Door should be more substanstantial. Nowhere to actually \"open\" it to put the new tank in - have to fiddle with it to get it to open. Rechecked after purchase, and all units are the same. Like the bottom dispense design. \"Have not own this unit long\" I bought this unit after my KitchenAid refrigerator stopped dispensing water and my two attempts at repair didn't solve the issue. I opted for the bottom loader, since my wife is 5'6\" and 110 lbs. I figured this would make it easier for her and my step-daughter who lives with us.Pros -Easy to setupEasy to load bottle waterLike the hot and cold water features, really hadn't thought about using hot water but my daughter uses it for teaQuietCons -Cold water isn't chilled but rather slightly below room temperatureHot water was not consistently available and the light for heating was not onThe design of the reservoir could be an issue, had to tape the lid shut as it was ajar after only 3 days use. \"Lovin' it\" Looks good in our home. Love that you don't have to look st the bottle sitting on the top. Easy to install and load \"Primo Water Cooler, Upgrade from Previous Model\" This purchase was to replace a previous Primo Water Cooler, a top load model. So far, I have noticed at least a couple of benefits with the upgraded model: As my water cooler sits atop a kitchen counter, loading a fresh water bottle entailed using a step-stool to crawl atop the kitchen counter, while holding the 35 pound water bottle. The newer bottom-loading model eliminates the need to leave the kitchen floor, and the cooler can stay in place while I replace the bottle. Additionally, this newer model is actuated by holding a glass against the levers on the front, so that a glass can be filled with water by using just one hand (the older model required two hands). \"Avoid at all cost\" Bought and worked good for 5 weeks now the cold water will not dispense.What a waste of moneyDO NOT BUY n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"A good unit!\" This unit is a house friendly very decent look, easy to operate, easy to load especially if you bought a refill 5gallons like me. The reason I wrote this review is I learned a lesson how to take care of this unit, first of all I will recommend to buy a 2yrs warrantty for $ 24 something to total of 3 yrs warranty including your 1 yr factory warranty so you have a peace of mind just like what I did to make story short my unit broke 20 days before my warranty expire and the lowes send me a merchandise card with the total amount of the unit.Tips: mostly the first thing to brake in a buttom load unit is the pump, so if the redlight is flashing don't wait to long, replace right away or turn it off or else the pump will be damage! thanks i hope this will help! \"i'm not sure about it yet, bad taste ran 9 gal.H20\" I ordered online, when I received from UPS it was busted, it looked like they just threw it around not caring what was in the box. took it to a Lowe's store for an exchange. This product needs water system flushed out before being boxed up to be shipped. Needs to have a on-off switch to shut pump off. Water flow is good, Temps are good, We like the paddle controls to get our water. Looks like the newer ones are push button. \"AWESOME!!!\" Just bought today!! Cold water is ice cold!!! Hot water is hot!! Easy to put together. I bought the warranty just in case. I am very pleased!! \"electrical usage ???\" I have this cooler for a year and it works good , handy the bodem fill for the bottles .Electrical use I have my doubts , I can't find in the watt's in the specifications and this thing is zooming almost the whole , not that we use it a lot 7 to 8 gallons a week and no hot water . \"Really like. Nice style and works well.\" Great customer service as usual. Really like the fact that I can get a military discount. Keeps me coming back. Thanks Lowe's ..... \"Much too noisey\" Have had it almost a year to the day, seems like it gets louder every week. Pump now chatters quite a bit when pulling from bottle. Thank goodness I bought a service plan, this is a lousy dispenser. \"It's a Leaker!\" Purchased and installed on a Monday - 5/21/18. Leaking by Friday - 5/25/18. PRIMO indeed! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Stick with the old style\" After having this bottom loader for a few weeks, I wish I kept the old style with top loading water bottle. Don't get me wrong this works flawlessly however you cannot see how water is left in the cooler even if the low level light is on. You don't know how many ounces are actually left, and bending over to put the cap on. You are still required to lift the bottle a bit anyways before you can slide it into the cooler it seems more difficult than picking it and loading it from the top. \"LOVE THIS WATER DISPENSER\" i bought this water dispenser like 2 months ago i had to give a review and a rate of 5 stars this thing is awesome the water is cold and the hot water is very hot and it has a child safety but speaking cold water its gets cold love it i would recommend this product either a family member or a friend. \"Avoid this product\" We purchased this with an extended protection plan. It's a good thing we got the extended protection plan! The first cooler we bought didn't get the water very cold. Then the pump in it died shortly after purchase. I called the company and my extended protection plan got me a replacement cooler. The second cooler worked okay for about 6 months. It is currently on brink of death just a little more than 1 year after purchase. It no longer cools water and it vibrates very bad when dispensing. Poor quality! Avoid this product! \"Garbage product\" Had this for maybe about a year before it started leaking watched their YouTube videos and did as they instructed in attempt to fix it a month later it leaks again from a different spot made the decision to replace it with a different brand and I was emptying the overflow trap below the spouts it leaks scalding water on my hand as if giving a final screw you \"Great\" I have had this dispenser for about 3years never had a problem does not stick out like a sore thumb I love it no leaking or anything n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Replacement for 15 yr old that went belly up\" I love the look of this unit and the colors match the current kitchen. Being able to place the bottle under instead of over and upside down allows my wife to fill unit without my help, love it. Miss the frig. my old unit had, but. Not having the bottle on top also allows for decorations there. Unit seems to be a little noisy when cooling water. \"Water Dispenser\" Excellent product, easy to set-up and load 5 gallon water bottles. My 12 year old daughter set it up. \"Not impressed\" I bought a new water cooler to replace one that died. It was Primo's bottom loader vs the old top loader. When i got it home and set it up, it started leaking all over my kitchen. I called technical support and the woman said it needed to be returned because it was defective. We could've just gotten a lemon. I ended up returning it the next day and exchanged it for Primo's top loader and it's working fine. \"Great Purchase!\" Great product and very quiet. This is my 2nd bottom loading water cooler and this one is better than the first. I have only had for a week, but everything is working great so far! \"A little noisy and spills\" I like this product because I have small children and I would not be comfortable with the heavy 5 gallon water jug on top. The cons to this water filter are that it's about as loud as having another refrigerator in the house. The noise is not constant but turns on and off as the water gets pumped up. That's the trade off for not having to lift the heavy jugs. The hot water dispenser gets stuck sometimes. So after you pull away the hot water continues to flow and spills everywhere and you could easily burn yourself. You have to press the red button to make it stop flowing. It would be nice if the cold water dispenser also had child safety that could be turned on or off as needed. \"LOUD!!!\" I had to give this one away--the cooling function is incredibly loud. Going to try the Pro and see if it's any better. \"Primo water cooler\" Works great, nice not having to lug the bottle up to the top, just slide it in and it works! \"Best water cooler ever!\" After having top loading water coolers over the years, they always flooded the kitchen without warning after a yr of use. We found this bottom loading one, which is easier than flipping the bottle & when it's time to replace, we won't have a flood. It looks so classy in our kitchen, it's so easy to load the bottle underneath, it's quiet, and the levers work faster than our old one that took forever to fill a glass. It has a safety feature on the hot water so it's great when kids are around. We are so happy with this purchase--highly recommend this water cooler! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"So far so good.\" I have owned this product for about a week - so far it works well - cold is cold and the hot is very hot - the water spickets are a bit to low but his I can live with, it is nice that it can take both three gallons and five gallons of water. The night light is a good feature but it is not very bright. The last water cooler lasted about ten years, this cooler lasted about twelve years, only time will tell. It is very nice that the bottle is out of sight on the bottom of the unit. I did take the extended guarantee from Lowe's. Hope I never need to use the extended guarantee, the cost for another two years is only $ 24.50. As I said so far so good - it also looks very nice. I do not use Primo water, buy from a local water company. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Started off good\" My wife and i purchased 1 of these units 4 weeks ago from our local Lowe's. When we got it home i unpacked the unit installed a 5 gallon Primo water bottle plugged it in and turned it on. The thing worked great for exactly 2 weeks then 1 morning i went to get a glass of water and absolutely nothing came out of either spigot. So to Primos website i went to troubleshoot. After watching the video 3 different times i tried all their remedies none of which worked. Slightly irritated i called their customer service and was transferred to a polite woman who walked me thru all their steps a second time. After verifying the unit wouldn't work she recorded the serial number and told me they would ship me another water dispenser from California and i would have it in 7 days and it would have a new warranty. My new unit arrived this Wednesday, i just unpacked and hooked it up tonight it works great at this time and only time will tell. Anyway while i was awaiting the delivery of the replacement cooler i searched the web and found that this unit is known to have pump issues and that they offer no pump replacement just entire unit replacement. If i could do it over again i would have just bought another top load cooler as my 6yr old top load cooler works just fine but didnt have a hot water options. \"Better than expected\" This was not the specific model that I had in mind after my old Primo bottom loader went out on me after 4 years but I'm glad that I made this purchase. Very quiet operation and looks good in the kitchen. Water is nice and cool within minutes after hook up. I like the one handed operation. On other models you need two hands to dispense water (one hand to press button and other to hold glass). No regrets with this purchase. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"worst water cooler ever made\" this water cooler leaked from every possible area imaginable,complete junk,now the inconvenience of returning it to lower may be just as bad. \"Perfect for us\" This cooler is so easy to use. I love that we can have hot water or room temp, plus the always cold option. It is so easy to load. We should have gotten this sooner. Great value and excellent product \"Purchased for our shop\" Only have had a few days that is why I gave it a 3 for quality, but so far it is working great. I like not having to lift the bottle way up to put on top of the cooler. I hope we get good service out of it but if not I purchase the warranty. \"Promo water cooler\" Water is so much better then plastic bottle water. this water cooler looks nice, works well. we love it! \"Easy to use and install!\" Loved that it loads from the bottom, so easy to use and change out the bottles. It isn't loud either, nor does it generate heat in the area. \"Primo Water Cooler\" I have a two year old unit in my home in Winter Haven. I recently purchased a Hamilton Beach for my home in Boca. Big mistake! The unit was noisy, continually clogged the water dispenser pipe and in general an inferior product to the Primo. Donated the Hamilton Beach and bought another Primo. Now we are quietly well hydrated at both our homes. \"Worked great when it worked\" Purchased this from Lowes back in April 2017. The dispenser never leaked and worked fine until May 2018 when the hot water heater stopped working. The warranty on this product is only 1 year and as only clean, bottled water was ever run through it I would have expected the heater to work for many years. Unfortunately it broke only 2 weeks out of warranty so I am stuck with it. The cold water side still works but for $179 I would expect a longer lasting life. \"Great Hydration Station\" As a family we drink a lot of water and our neighborhood recently had our water pipes updated so we were relying on bottled water all summer. I wish we would have gotten this sooner to reduce as much waste(we still recycled) as possible. The only thing about the product that I didn't like is that we couldn't lock the cold water also. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"pleased so far...\" Just got this home and running. FYI, item #577843 is the new version of item #186795, which has 74 reviews.It's nice to just slide the bottle into the cabinet from the floor without having to lift it. It sits solidly on the floor and doesn't feel like it is in danger of tipping over. To dispense cold water, you simply push back on the lever. To dispense hot water, you have to push in the red button on the front then push back on the lever. The motor is very loud when you first plug it in but is virtually silent once you put the plunger into the bottle of water. Our water delivery service bottles have a cap with a stopper in it to help prevent spills when flipping it over. In order to use them in this dispenser, you have to completely remove the cap before inserting the probe/plunger. The cold water flows much more quickly than the hot water. The only \"problem\" so far is how wide the hinged side of the cabinet is. It hinges on your left as you are facing and it cannot be against a wall because it needs too much space to swing open. I am concerned about the negative reviews of the manufacturer's customer service, but I have to take the chance. There are not many dispenser choices under the $200 mark. Sorry I had to replace my 8 year old dispenser but I hope this one lasts just as long. \"Love the system!!\" Bought this for my mother so she wouldn't have to keep waiting on me to load a new water bottle. The ability to just slide the new bottle in without lifting is a win-win for everyone!! \"Awesome Buy\" So I purchased my unit three weeks ago. So far, so good. The Cold water is nice and cold and the Hot water is Hot. The night light is a bonus because no need to turn on kitchen lights to get a drink of water. It's fairly quiet as well. Goes great with my kitchen decor too. Thanks \"LOVE this!\" Great price, but works great. quiet operation. Just what I needed for my home office. I don't think I've ever had this much intake of water in my life. A great way to get me to drink more! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Worked for a Month\" This cooler worked great for three months then it stopped working. I unplugged it and tried to reset it to no avail. I even went on YouTube and watched tutorials on how to reset it; still no luck. Bottom line - this is a piece of crap. Avoid it. My Grandma always said you get what you pay for. She was right. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"LOVED IT...until the pump went out\" I purchased this water cooler in January of 2017 and loved it until August of 2018 when the pump went out and it stopped dispensing water. Thought it would be an easy fix but I was wrong. Searched the internet and contacted Primo only to find that you can not get a small replacement pump and have to buy a new unit. Disappointed...for the cost buying cases of bottled water would have been cheaper. \"I brought the first model of the primo\" I brought the first bottom load primo model two of them at Lowe's now I have had them for two years I'm a contractor and I carry one of them around from job to job when the unit is empty the heater and cooler will continue to stay on their not automatic cut off switch, so I was told by lowes associate when the unit is empty cut the heater of immediately which is the red glowing switch, reason is the diaphragm cap will heat up loose it shape then unit will leak so I paid attention to what the associate told me and I never had one issue for 2 year and both of them are used around the clock.. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Water Cooler\" Not only is this a great product but the staff was helpful and kind about helping with this purchase. I will be making all other buys at Lowe's now! \"Very happy with this water cooler!\" Easy to load the 5 gallon container. The water heats & cools fast and I like the flat top - provides a place for the plastic glasses! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Not a high rise\" Just like everything now adays, plastic is the main substance used for construction. with this unit, one does not have to strain to get the bottle up on top of the dispenser. Also there is no weight sitting on top of the plastic weighing it down to weaken it to create cracks.With the bottle hidden you have to open the door ocassionaly to see the amount of water in the bottle to be prepared for it getting emptied. \"Hot has too wide of range.\" The dispenser works very well but the hot has a temp range that it could be. It isn't always as hot as I would like it to be. Would be nice to have a control on hot temp. \"Totally worth it\" I'm not a big fan of tap water and making the wife flip a 5 gallon tank upside down wasn't happening. Bottom load would have to be it. Price was fair and there really wasn't anything special putting it together. The wife could have bought it, lifted it, and installed it herself. The water tank is heavier than this machine :) Could have used a button for straight water (not hot or cold), but whatever... I like it. \"Appealing and Useful\" Water cooler in sleek color. Jug is tucked away behind the door. Easy to operate. Very nice and practical. Very reasonable price also. \"Works great!\" Hot and Cold water. Found that it kept trying to load water from bottle, discovered the hose at the pump was not fully connected. Now works! n/a The plastic dispenser levers are the only thing I don't like about it! \"Nice Water Cooler!\" Easy set-up, simple to use - nice that the water jug is in the base and we don't have to lift to change. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Looks great, breaks quickly\" Bought a model 601144 on April 25, 2018. It looked great and chilled well. This morning, the pump became very noisy and will not suck. And when I tilted the dispenser a little bit to move it away from the wall, a quarter cup of rusty water leaked onto the floor. Not even going to make a warranty claim -- don't want the thing (or its buddies) in my house. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Water cooler works well and looks good.\" We have had this for a couple of weeks, and it is working very well. Cold water is definitely cold enough and the hot water is good enough to make tea. No visible water bottle is also a plus. \"Cold and Hot Water Cooler is great!\" Hot water heats up instantly while holding the red button as if it was heated up on the stove or in the microwave. Being able to load the water in the bottom of the machine is also a great feature, you don't have to see the water on top of the machine. The machine is a little loud at times, but the loudness doesn't last long it does quiet down. Overall it's a great cooler. Would have given it five stars, took a star away for the loudness of the cooler. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Returning After 3 Days\" I bought this water cooler for my wife 3 days ago. We have a well and my wife doesnt like the taste of the water. I bought the bottom load so she never had to lift the heavy bottles and to keep water from sloshing out when loading the top ones. We have not gotten any water out of the cooler, except when installing it and making sure it worked. We get up this morning and see water on the floor around the cooler. I open up the door and the 5 gallon water bottle is completely empty. We find the carpet in the room next to the room soaked, as well as standing water in the pantry, right next to where the cooler was placed. I managed to get less than a gallon of water out of the cooler, which means i have over 4 gallons of water in my carpet and under my kitchen floor. Not very happy that i have had this cooler 3 days. Total piece of junk that is being returned as soon as i get off work, and wont be replacing it! \"Great cooler\" I love this cooler. Initially it took a while to heat and cool the water but it is pretty fast now. \"Primo Water (heater) Cooler\" We are really enjoying this product. My husband loves just getting up and the using it for hot coffee water. We both enjoy everything about it. \"Primo Perfection\" Absolutely love this product so easy to set up and water is cooled within minutes \"Cool water, SO LOUD, endless noise\" Convenient bottom fill but if you enjoy the quiet of a solitary early morning breakfast do not buy this unit. The unit makes such a racket that it has destroyed the peace and quiet if iut lovely kitchen. \"Great water dispenser\" Love that I no longer have to lift the water bottle onto the cooler. Now, I just have to slide in place, put the pump cap on and it's good to go. \"no heavy lifting\" Replaced my older primo water cooler. Much better with water bottle on bottom instead of top loading. Now my wife can change bottle without heavy lifting and spilling water n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Junk\" Purchased from Lowes in July. Stopped working in September. So $200 for two months equals $1200 per year for cold water. What a bargain. Currently does a great job dispensing tepid water. Tried everything in the manual to troubleshoot. No luck. Support is only available during working hours. If I quit my job I can call Support and then perhaps they can help me get this unit to dispense cold water. \"Door dented out of the box,but works great..so far\" Works well so far and set-up is a breeze, I like the idea of being able to just slide the bottle in the bottom instead of lifting them on top but even so there will be some spillage when you stick the water probe in the bottle because the water bottles are filled to the top but that is no biggie. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because when I unpacked it the bottom door was dented and all banged up to the point that I can barely open the door to get the bottle in, I checked Primo's website and they have replacement door assemblies instead of returning to Lowes since the closest one is 45 minutes away I will just go through Primo instead of the hassle of running back to Lowes. The cold water works great, I didn't use the hot water I have that turned off. I hope it holds up to everyday use I have my fingers crossed, I already have 1 strike for the dented door, if it doesn't last long, this will be my first and last from Primo \"Nice water dispenser\" Its nice and I like that I don't have to tip the bottle of water upside down. I don't like how it leaves a little bit of water in the cooler once the red light flashes letting me know its time to replace it with a new bottle. \"water dispenser\" Full operation was quick and easy and the bottom load feature makes it so much easier \"Worked good for awhile\" Bought the Model 900133 bottom loader back in February 2013. Worked great for the first year and a half. Then the cooler pump was so loud cooling the water we just shut it off. Within the last few months the red light came on when the jug was still half full. Did some trouble shooting and adjusted the hoses. Primo gives you very little to go by for trouble shooting. Then within the past week the pump slowly started to fail then broke. Looked up on line for a new pump and found out I could get the same one for $152.00. There were a few other cheaper ones different design but did not have the same specs. For how long it lasted the average cost ended up $5.70 per month so I guess it is not to bad deal but should have lasted longer for only two people using it. I am going back to the top loader and decided to forget about the pump. I was a nice feature but with the noise and unreliable pump it will pay to go back to the top. \"Water cooler Omni\" I like nite light the hot water the water is not as cold as I would like it to be that's the only thing wrong,the size and height is great nice and compact \"Lowe's BAD on a BAD Product\" We purchased one of these Black/SS Bottom-Loading Cold and Hot Water Cooler ENERGY STAR water coolers. Within a month or two it started leaking. Primo sent us a replacement. Within a couple of weeks, that one started leaking. Again, a replacement. Within a few days that one started leaking.Lowe's was horrible. They wouldn't stand behind their sale. They just referred us to the manufacturer. I won't buy from Lowe's again for our business or for myselfThe manufacturer asked us to perform several troubleshooting steps, but can only send us another replacement. Do they REALLY think we want another one? They offered a slightly different model, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with anything from them.I'd stay away from Lowe's and from Primo. Get something else. n/a Very pleased with the Primo water cooler,I purchased on November 24 th, its very quite and efficient, would recommend this product to family and friends. \"Water Cooler\" The water cooler was easy to install and friendly priced. Our family enjoy it and use it frequently. \"Primo Water Cooler\" We have purchased Primo/Black Bottom Loading Cold and Hot Water Cooler Energy Star. Have had it a Few months and it works Great. Hot is Hot and Cold is Cold or you can drink not so cold water. Love the night light and easy bottom loading.c n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"So-so\" I have a love hate relationship with this water cooler. I love how it's bottom loading and the simplicity of it, but there is one thing I hate about it! With my old water cooler, my water was ALWAYS cold. Even when the water jug was empty, the water in the cooler remained cold. With this water cooler, the second the bottle is empty, it stops cooling the water. I'm not sure how much water is held in the cooler (I know it's a minimum of 30 oz. because I'm able to fill up my 30 oz tumbler even when the water jug is empty), but it comes out room temperature! It's really irritating because I don't realize that my bottle is empty and by the time it blinks indicating that the bottle is empty, my cooler water is no longer cool. If you change out the bottle immediately, this won't be an issue for you. But it's an issue for me. I wouldn't buy this cooler again. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Water dispenser\" It looks and feels sturdy. Nice to look at. Switching bottles is super easy. Buy protection plan. Mine stopped cooling after a couple of months. I purchased it again because I am done with water bottles. \"Primo bottom loading hot/cold water dispenser\" Easy to unpack, very quiet unit, only improvement I would request is a taller unit so I don't need to bend over to use. You would figure engineers would think of that sort of thing it's a common problem among these units because I've now owned 3 of them. \"Poor Quality product\" Stay away from this product. Bought this product and after 8 months coldwater pump when out and began to vibrating really loud when using hot water downpour. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"More than adaquate\" A water cooler is a simple thing. This one is straight forward but with some nice additions for a base model. It is capable of both cooling and heating water, but if you don't use one (for me I don't need hot water) you can switch that function off to conserve a little electricity. The night light above the dispenser is also a great option. \"Excellent product that satisfies our demands.\" Always able to find what we need and someone is ready to assist when help is needed. \"Good unit at a fair price\" This is the third water cooler I purchased in the last month.The first one from another store arrived in pieces,the second one was a $250 bottom loader, the compressor rattled when it shut down and the pump made noise every time it ran.Several bottom loaders have the same complaint.I went back to what I had for 8 years with no issue a top loader that wasnt the cheapest but had the features I wanted for our office.I had the Primo cooler for a couple weeks now and its great.Cold water is ice cold and hot water is perfect.I dont hear it run either its very quite.I am very happy with this unit. \"DO NOT BUY!\" We bought our first cooler in May of last year. Never having one before, we weren't sure what was normal and what was not. Ours would make a loud knocking/boiling sound periodically. After hearing from a friend that it was not normal, I called Primo and they said they would send me a new one, no questions asked. They sent me another one and within a week this one is getting progressively louder. I can no longer return it to Lowe's, and I really don't want another Primo one. Save yourself a headache and go with another brand. \"No water on hot side so can't plug it in\" Per the instructions, I can not plug the unit in because it says NOT to plug the unit in until water will dispense from hot side. I've followed the instructions about shaking slightly and tapping the bottle. I've re-seated the bottle. Water will come out the cold side but not the hot side. I went to Primo's site but could not get my question answered. I just bought it yesterday and tried to set it up today. \"Nice product for the price\" This is our fourth water cooler. This one is working well for the first month. Water is cold, however there is no thermostat to control how cold- no setting at all for the cold. You can turn on/off the hot. My only concern is the plastic 'paddles' that you push against to dispense the water. It is very convenient (vs holding in a button), but, just wondering how long they will last without breaking. Hopefully it is a replaceable part. Also, a $50 ComEd Electric Co rebate was helpful in the purchase. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"2 years and stop cooling\" After 2 years my water cooler stopped cooling. I reviewed the videos an d contacted manufacture. No luck, unplugged waited an, still not cooling. To make me feel better they offered to sale me a new cooler for $95? No thanks, it will break in 2 years. I'll buy from someone else. \"To good to be true\" It started off nice but after about ten 5 gallon bottles it started to leak from the top. which means a big 5 gallon puddle on your floor. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"2 year product\" Like all the other reviews I read... Mine too quit working at the 2 year mark. Compressor is shot! I thought I'd just buy again and get the extended warranty but they only offer a 2 year warranty at the store so that's useless. Time to find another manufacturer! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"My first water dispenser I have ever bought and...\" I LOVE IT! Not using a traditional water jug of 3 or 5 gallons, but using a water filtering system that accepts ordinary tap water and filters it. What I get is purified, filtered tap water and extra $ in my wallet from not having to buy bottled water anymore! The dispenser is great. I do like the paddle dispensers, but the hot water at times sticks, causing overflow.Another reviewer mentioned the sharing of germs with the paddle design, and I can see it in an office setting. But this is for my residence, so really not a concern for me at this point.Temps are excellent; cold water is refreshing, and hot water is piping hot. Minimal background noise from compressor, and i like to removable drip tray feature, also.Overall, a great product that serves its purpose, just slightly irritated with the sticking of the hot water paddle, thus the 4 star rating. The next thing to be determined is longevity, which I hope to get, at the least, 2 years out of this water dispenser. For the price, a great water dispenser. n/a Not enough hot water and sits too low to the ground. We did not like it at all. \"water cooler\" Exactly what I needed. Hot or cold water immediately when I want it. \"Wish I'd gotten One Sooner!\" I've only had the cooler a few weeks, but so far it's great!! I had put off getting one for over a year, simply because I hadn't gotten around to it. Now I wish I'd gotten one sooner!!!It would be nice if it had a room temperature function (I've put my pets on bottled water too!), but using both the hot and cold together, accomplishes the same thing :)My only complaint if I had one, is I wish there was a way to disable the safety button on the hot side. I realize it's to prevent children from accidentally scalding themselves, but wish it could be disabled for those of us who will never have children near it. \"Great water dispenser!\" We have owned this dispenser for years and it has been 100% reliable! It is easy to use, although it takes some balance and muscles to replace a 5 gallon jug. \"I was nervous too\" This is actually a good buy. I was nervous but went ahead on it and am glad for it. You will be too. \"leaks\" It started off nice but after about 6 months it started to leak from the top. $170 wasted and now I have to pay just to drop it off at the dump... \"Leaking after 2 days\" We purchased a primo water cooler on Friday, and two days later on Sunday, the hot side of the cooler has a continuous leak. The reviews on this product mention the leaking issue. Why the company has not corrected the problem is surprising. Why Lowes continues to carry the defective product leaves me speechless. \"Primo SS Water Cooler 4 stars\" We have had it a full week now and it's working great. The water is cold and hot when turned on from the back. The one nice surprise was a night light built in. Didn't know that. It's low enough that my wife who is 5'3\" can put the 5 gallon Bottle on this unit with no issues. The only Real Negative thing we have to say about this unit is it's really loud when the unit is attempting to cool the water. We just turned the cool unit part off since we use ice in our water anyways. Problem solved. In all fairness we do have hardwood floors so it tends to make all noises in our home louder. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Good buy\" Read many reviews before purchasing and were not good but the reviews were a couple years old referring to leakage and problems with dispense handles but 2016 of June maybe manufacturing problems were corrected or operator error. Because cooler is designed for the water bottles that have the spill proof insert in bottle cap because you're not supposed to peel the cap off just the protective plastic sheeting that exposes the self piercing part of the bottle cap. This cooler has the spigot in it that when put bottle on top it will pierce the opening in it therefore controlling water flow without spills or leakage \"Wish I could love it...\" I love the look of this cooler and was so excited it would be great. Unfortunately, every bottle we put on ends up leaking and we find a huge mess in the kitchen. I don't know why. Very disappointed and we will be returning it. \"Leaked first night\" I was hoping to love this water cooler, but unfortunately it slowly leaked from the cool dispenser all through the night, the first night it was set up. I will return it and try it again. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"So far so good\" Best thing, it has an on off switch for hot/cold/light cause I really only use the cold water setting. Not a drawback for me because I have two little ones but it is short and I am tall. The filler nozzle is 24\" from the floor. Great for kids, we drink lots of water. It's quiet and don't have to worry about the pump going out on the bottom feeders. \"good quality top loading water cooler\" found this at a local lowes and decided to get it because of the nice black color and the paddle style tabs for dispensing the water. read bad things about the button style dispensers leaking so figured this is probably a newer design and being that not EVERY lowes store has this I figured it must be fairly new and they're trying to sell out the old style stock before refreshing all stores with this model. considering it is the same price as the other black top loader it was a very easy decision.came home, unpacked (easy), put new fresh water bottle on top (unit punctures when you load it), plug in (cord is a very good length so you should have no issue with placement)), turn on cold &/or hot switches in back, dispense a cup or two of water to flush out the lines as recommended in the manual, wait an hour or 2 for the water to reach temp, and finally, enjoy! wife does like the taste and loves the convenience of cold water without having to open the fridge constantly grabbing bottles or the brita pitcher (which doesn't get rid of all tastes from tap water)save yourself some money and invest in one of these, don't bother with the bottom load models unless you absolutely have trouble lowering your arm to fill up your water.almost time to buy a replacement bottle and keep one in the basement as a spare so I don't have to run to the store immediately after running out. don't forget to turn off your switches or just unplug the unit when removing empty water bottles. don't want any of the coils to get damaged!register this on primo website for warranty coverage!! \"Not what I needed for\" Very nice looking but it will not fit water filtering bottles. Not paying for filtered water! n/a Purchased two for family members and they both lovd it. \"Primo\" Easy installation. Appreciate the ability to have both hot and cold water. Also, looking forward to not having to buy cases of bottled water and having to recycle. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Great Product!\" Purchased a month ago has been great so far!

Easy to install, easy to change bottles. \"Great Water Cooler!\" Needed to replace a water cooler that was freezing up on me. researched many and settled on this one. I am not sorry I did! It keeps water very cold and when hot spigot is used, it is certainly hot enough! \"Primco top loading hot & cold water cooler\" Reasonable price.Very cold water.I recommend this product \"Compact\" Not too cumbersome. Fits in small spaces Water is cold \"Water Cooler\" I am thinking about returning it, The cooler just doesn't get the water cold..... \"Very please with this water cooler\" Moved 'down' from a bottom bottle fed unit that looked 'cleaner' but was loud and continuously had pressure issues. Sure I have to lift the bottle to the top but the gravity fed mechanism works much better, no dispensing issues or loud grinding pump sounds. Heats and cools the water with no issues.K.I.S.S. prevails over a cleaner looking unit. \"So far so good\" We use this at my work and it been doing well for consistsnt usage for the last month or so n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a So far, it works as advertised and doesn't take up a lot of space in my little kitchen. \"BEWARE - Push paddles to get the water\" I bought this unit for our office and it didn't even dawn on me that this unit uses \"push paddles\" to fill/refill your cup. Although the unit seems to be made fairly well and got good reviews, I can't get over the fact that every time someone refills their cup, they are spreading germs onto the same paddle that I will use to fill up my cup and vice versa. In today's day and age of germs everywhere, this is a poor, poor design.I passed on the unit below this one because it got bad reviews but at least that one uses buttons up top to fill your bottle/cup and you don't actually push your cup against a paddle as everyone else has before you. Had I realized this beforehand I would not have purchased this unit. \"This one works\" After replacing an older Primo cooler with another Primo like the first, it leaked just like the first one. This more expensive one seems to be working just fine. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Good Good\" It is a nice water dispenser. The black and stainless looks sharp in my apartment. I do wish the cold was colder. I will give you a heads up though... the hot is very hot. I temped mine at about 180 F. I can brew coffee and make ramen very quickly. I don't have kids so this isn't an issue for me. There is a two step process to get hot water but any smart kid could figure it out. I'm just giving you a heads up. IF you boil water on the stove and then remove it for about five minutes estimate that is 180 F. I've seen people claim that theirs only reaches about 100 F. I found this to be incorrect. As I said I checked mine with a food probe and an infrared thermometer. Great water cooler though. \"Water dispenser\" Great water dispenser would recommend it to friends and family \"poor design\" The push paddles were hard to use. We reuse our small water bottles. The paddle caused a lot of spilled water. Also could not fill a 1 gallon jug. We ended up keeping our old dispenser and returning this one. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Finally, freedom from tapwater.\" Good quality, no complaints. Hot and cold water. It is a little low so they offer a base that brings it up to normal person level. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Primo Warer Cooler\" Our water cooler sprung a leak after 10 years and we needed a replacement. This water cooler has been an excellent replacement. The hot water is hot enough to brew tea. Very happy with the price and value. \"Keeps Water Cold and Dispenses Hot Water\" Great water cooler! We get the jugs filled at the grocery store. This set up cost us $160 upfront, but it saves us a ton of money over buying water bottles or signing up for a water delivery service. It's also better for the environment.Pros:Works greatWater is very coldDispenses hot water quicklyCons:It's low to the ground, so it's a little awkward to fill bottles/cups. This could be remedied by putting the cooler on a stand of some sort, but then it would be awkwardly tall to load the new heavy water bottles. This is a very minor inconvenience, I'd recommend getting a bottom load cooler if you can't bend over/load from the top. However they are more expensive and you have to deal with additional moving parts (water pump). n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Keep your eyes peeled...\" I did go and buy it at the nearest Lowe's and I printed the product with the price of $149.00 on it but when you go in the store it is priced at $179.00. I do know it is a good product because I know some people [3] that had them from a few years to several years and had never any problems with them. This is my first electrical water cooler, I still have my old water cooler [a ceramic one] that I kept for almost 30 years. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Good Investment\" I have been pleased with it so far. The only thing I don't like is with me being nearly 6 foot tall, it seems like a long way to reach down and get water, especially when filling a pitcher. It would be nice if it were a little taller. The hot water is great for instant coffee and set up was easy. \"Short and leaks after bottle replacement\" I have had this water cooler for a week. We bought the first bottle of water and loaded it with no issues. It cooled and heated the water great. It was a bit on the short side, but we were willing to live with that and even considered constructing a base for it to sit on to lift it about a foot.We finished our first 5 gallon container in 3 or 4 days, and I exchanged the bottles before I went to bed. When we awoke, we found 5 gallons of water on the floor. The water is leaking from the Top of the cooler. I refilled the old water bottle with the little remaining water from the 5 gallon container and placed that on top to see if it was the water bottle, and the same leak persisted.Hopefully they will refund me for the lost 5 gallons ($14.99 since it was a first bottle and not an exchange) along with the cooler. Not sure if I will give this particular cooler a second chance. \"Stopped cooling after two years\" I like the cooler, looks good dispenses water fine, but after two years stopped working. The compressor kicks on but the water never gets cold at all in fact it's always room temperature. When it did cool the water really wasn't that cold anyway. I've re-set the unit followed every troubleshooting guide. Primo just says re-set by un plugging unit, wait 24 hrs. Plug back in and you should be all set, did that several times no luck. You have to be careful when it stops cooling the unit will grow bacteria. n/a Easy set up, even easier to operate. Very cold and very hot water within a matter of minutes of hookupQuiet operation. \"Leaks\" After 1 1/2 days came home to find water all over the floor. Most of the parts were wet so it was difficult to track the leak. Bottom line...it's crap. Don't buy. Should be a 0 star review, but that's not allowed. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Primo Water Dispenser\" I love this water dispenser. I live in a place that you can't drink the tap water and this is a savior!! Definitely recommend this product and it's very quiet heating element is a plus. Oh,and Lowe's beat everyone else's price!! Thank you Lowe's! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Top load water dispenser\" So far, so good. The unit is only two weeks old. It is a replacement for a bottom load dispenser that lasted only two months. That unit was a different brandThis one is so quiet, that I can't even tell when the compressor is running.The water comes out properly cooled or piping hot from the two spigots. I like that you can select to heat or cool water independently. It's not all or nothing like some dispensers. \"Awesome water cooler\" This water cooler is awesome! The water from it comes out cold like right from the fridge and even hot like you just finished boiling it! Would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great water cooler. \"Good for the price\" Works well. Nice having hot water instantly without having to wait. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Flip of a coin\" Heater went out after 4 months. A replacement is on the way. If #2 fail's they will send me another one. I keep the one I have. I doubled down with a 2 yr Service plan from Lowe's. Went I'm done Lowe's will refund my purchase. Good for the next 3 yr + How cool is that? \"Great water fountain. Very quiet. Looks good.\" We have had five or six water fountains before, some rented, some bought, and this is the best so far. Take it out of the box, put in a water bottle, plug it in and turn on the switches on the back, and you are set. No big assembly. Very quiet which was important for us, since ours is in the living room and our last one (a rental from Poland Springs/Nestle) was very noisy and made all kinds of strange sounds. The hot water is probably not hot enough to make tea right from the water fountain, but it sure speeds up boiling the water, and its good for warm drinks. I love the push button (like the drink fountains at restaurants), so you just push your glass against it to fill it. For hot water you need to also push the button as a security measure for children. Looks pretty good too with the stainless and black. It is a lot shorter than our last one in height, so you have to bend down more to use it. We might get a little stand for it (we are all tall though). \"Primo Water Cooler\" I purchased this water cooler because I liked the look with the black and chrome exterior and the price was reasonable. The appearance is much more professional looking than the typical white coolers. I would recommend this product. n/a Only used for 3 days. Will see how it works a month from now \"Awesome Product\" I'm glad I purchased this dispenser, not only does it dispense cold water but it also heats it, the price was great considering the benefits it provides. I'm thinking of purchasing a couple more for my family. Very happy overall. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Good product\" Great price. Easy installation. Bottle is super easy to install without the heavy lifting. The only thing I did not like is that there is a center button that should be for room temp water. But it does nothing. Instead you have to push up and down a small red button on the button to the hot water for room temp water. \"Easy load\" Bought this and it works great! We didn't need hot water and we liked that we can turn off the heating and or cooling and just have room temp! \"Descent priduct\" This cooler works great, I'd gladly recommend to anyone. One thing that upsets me with this, was the store i purchased it from (lowes) assured us that there is a night light in this unit, the owners manual stated it as well. However this unit DOES NOT have a night light. Be careful buying descriptions are false \"Primo White Bottom-Loading Cold and Hot Water Cool\" After reading positive reviews I purchased this cooler 2 weeks ago. Set up was easy and has been working well. Water is cold and hot water is extremely hot. I would recommend this cooler. \"Primo White Bottom-Loading Cold and Hot Water Cool\" After reading positive reviews I purchased this cooler 2 weeks ago. Set up was easy and has been working well. Water is cold and hot water is extremely hot. I would recommend this cooler. \"Cooler Works Great\" The bottom loading cooler work great and it is super easy to load the bottles of water. I highly recommend this cooler. \"Hot water does not work.\" On & off the phone with Primo. Still no hot water. Returning it, getting a refund! \"I don't usually write reviews, but it's loud\" Works as advertised, but it's loud. I think because it has to pump the water up (the water doesn't sit on top, it's down below), the pump has a loud sound, plus the cooling and heating system. I wish I could return it, but it's only just started being loud (had it 6 months or so now). I have another type at work with the water on top and that one is quite, but this one is annoyingly loud! \"primo company\" I purchased this water cooler a couple of weeks ago it stared leaking after a few days. I called Primo after a few trouble shooting questions rep said they would send me a new 1. I received it 4 days later and after 2 weeks no leaks and working like it should. Very happy with the out come \"Love it!\" Works great and it is nice to not have to lift the bottles anymore. It dose have a small rattle sometimes. But the box was damaged so that could have been the cause. A tiny piece of cardboard fixed it. \"The Primo IS \"PRIMO\"!\" Very easy to set up and switch water jugs. If you want a hot cup of tea or make instant coffee, it dispenses very hot water in a safe manner. Relatively quiet for all it has going on. Cold water will be very refreshing this summer - really looking forward to it for my family and pets! Appreciate the free shipping from Lowe's! \"Nice!\" The ONLY thing that was misinformed about this cooler... it does NOT have a night light where the manual says it does. It is only a green tiny light that is where the cold water comes out. Other than that, dispenser is much better than old fashion ones where you had to lift the 5-gallon heavy jug of water \"Hot Cold Dispenser\" waters not as cold as I would have liked - otherwise a great purchase \"Cold water, easy setup\" After reading a variety of mixed reviews, we proceeded to order the bottom loading cooler after our ancient top loading cooler expired. Bottom line, water comes out nice and cold, hot water is really hot. Easy to load the 5 gallon jug in and we no longer have to look at it since it is hidden down below. Quick setup with no problems. Only one minor design flaw and that is the spouts are difficult to see when standing in front of the unit to dispense water. One must bend over to see where the they are located otherwise you can have a torrent of water flying out and missing the cup. Needs some graphic indicators on the front to make it easy to line up your cup with the recessed spout. We added our own large red and green round stickers to help with lining up a cup or glass. Otherwise, good product. \"As expected\" I have owned this cooler for 3 weeks and so far have no complaints. Everything is working as expected and hoped for. \"Water Cooler is Great!\" Super easy to load a five gallon water jug on the bottom. Streamline and looks good in kitchen. Great and Recommend for home use. Glad I picked this style. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Excellent Value\" This is my first bottom dispenser and so far I'm very pleased. I really like the buttons being on top, don't have to bend over all the time. However, the hot water button child safety feature is too simple. U simply push the button forward and then down. Wouldn't take a 3 year old long to figure out. The 5 gallon water jug being at the bottom is also easy on the back. The quality is above average and it appears to be pretty sturdy. The water comes out piping hot or ice cold. \"Water dispenser\" Wasn't looking for a super expensive water dispenser. Also was looking for a bottom loading one and this was definitely the one with the best price. Only thing is that it doesn't have a room temperature option just has hot and cold but still works great! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Great addition\" Purchased for my mother in law, she uses it for tea, ramen, drinks and thoroughly enjoys it. I appreciate it being a bottom loader and not spilling everywhere. \"First Water Cooler\" I am really satisfied with this water cooler purchase. It is really easy to load a 5 gallon jug and hook it up..Love the fact I don't have to heat up water or tea or instant coffee. It comes out boiling hot so the tea bags are giving you great tasting tea in 3 minutes. The price of 149.99 is well worth it.. \"Doesn't Last\" Bought it a little over a year ago and it worked great until after the warranty went out. We started to notice a burning smell and realized it was coming from the Primo water cooler. We unplugged it over night and the smell went away but now the water taste like the burning smell. We have changed the bottle of water out twice and it still taste like burning plastic! Wouldn't recommend buying unless you buy the 2 year replacement warranty!! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Like This a Lot!\" We actually had to purchase this twice: the first one arrived in excellent condition, and set up was exactly by the book, but after a couple of hours, we noticed that the cold compressor never shut off. The hot water heater was cycling off and on, but not the cold. The machine seemed to be putting out a lot of hot air, so we shut the cold switch off overnight and tried it the next day, with the same results. We called Primo and were offered the choice of them sending out a new one (with us shipping the malfunctioning one back to them), or return it to our Lowe's store, which is what we did, for a no-hassle refund. Plenty of apologies all around from Primo and Lowe's. They had water dispensers in the store that seemed very nice, but all our appliances are white, so we reordered at the website again. The second one arrived in perfect condition, set up went great, but the hot water button did not depress. We called Primo again, and the customer service representative talked me through a minor adjustment that needed to be made; something had dislodged during shipping, but it was an easy fix needing only a screwdriver. That was a couple of weeks ago, and we have both hot and cold water at our fingertips whenever we want it. Even though we got off to a rocky start, things worked out to our satisfaction. The hot water is plenty hot for instant beverages such as tea or cocoa, and the cold water is very refreshing. We think the machine looks great in our kitchen and suits us perfectly. \"So far so good\" I am really liking this water cooler so far, my only complaint is there is no light. When I was looking at the product in the store I was under the impression that there was a light, even the documentation that came with the water cooler references a light but, there is no light. I would give a five-star review if there was a light, especially since I was led to believe that there was a light included. \"Primo\" We drink more water now as a result of owning the Primo Water Dispenser. Water tastes great and is always cold; which in Arizona is a real bonus. \"Works as advertised\" Perfect fit for our kitchen. Easy set up and safety on top to prevent accidental hot water pour. \"Primo White Bottom-Loading cooler\" I got this because I wanted a water cooler and thought this would be great since I wouldn't need to lift the heavy water jug into the cooler. First, the door wouldn't stay closed and then when I tried to fill a 2 quart jug so I could fill my pets' water bowls around my house, the water stream was so slow it took more than 5 minutes to fill the jug. I did this only ONE TIME and decided nope returning this.I have returned this. I still search for a good bottom loading water cooler. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Delivered in poor shape\" I'm not sure if this is due to faulty manufacturing, poor quality control, or what, but this machine was delivered with several vital components disconnected. First, the instructions were followed to a \"T\", plugged it in, and waited while the pump filled the tank. After a few minutes, water started pouring out of the overflow hole all over our office floor (carpet, of course). Quickly unplugged, turned to Google to see how to disassemble, and found that the small electrical wire connecting the overflow bobble sensor was not plugged in to the motherboard. Took it apart, found the slot on the electrical panel, plugged it in, and finally no more water pouring all over the flow. Next, after a half hour, we went to fill our water glasses, and nothing. No water came out of either hot or cold spouts. Again, took top off, turned to Google, and found that the spigots inside the device were not lined up on the little plastic runners. Push button for water lifted these plastic runners, opened the hose to allow water to pour. Saw both hot and cold were not connected, so we connected these. Finally after about a gallon of water on our office carpet, we finally have a water cooler we can use. And YES, it was delivered like this. NO, we will never buy from Lowes again, and NO we will never buy a Primo water cooler when this one finally goes out. Would NOT recommend this product, or from Lowes, as this was shipped from a Lowes facility so it had to be have been handled extremely rough for all these components to come unplugged. Would not buy Primo again, because of this same reason as well. \"Great !!!\" I bought this over the summer and my husband and I love it!!! No more buying cases of water every week. We buy 4 5gallon jugs and they last about 2 months!! I would recommend this to anyone looking for one!! \"Primo bottom load water dispenser\" I absolutely love this bottom load water dispenser. I had the top loading dispenser, it was good, but with my arthritis I could not lift 5 gals of water always had to have someone to help. So, I opted for the bottom loader and it is so easy to put the 5gal water bottle in, just slide in the bottom of water dispenser. If I can do it, anyone can...so, buy one you will not be dissappointed. Lowes had the best price and free delivery. \"Loved it\" We love our new Primo water dispenser. We got it for a great price as well. \"So far so good\" Have had this about a week now. We only have the cold water turned on but like the fact that we can have hit if we choose. Love the fact that the bottle goes on the bottom, it's so easy to change the bottle! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"OK but has flaws to be aware of\" It's a nice device, but it's too tall to sit on a counter. It blocks the cabinet door. You need to sit it on a table . The button is too stiff. When the bottle is near empty the pressure needed to push the button can shove the device across the counter and if you're not careful on to the floor. \"But a different one\" The water stream is ridiculously slow and you have to keep lifting the bottle to get air bubbles in to continue flow. The button is very hard to push in and the reservoir tank mentioned in the video is non existent. The bottle sits all the way onto the poked piece so there's no room for it to fill. \"Do not purchase\" I purchased one of these and it wouldn't even fill a twelve ounces glass of water before it stopped. I wouldn't recommend this unit to anyone. Spend more money and get a product that works. \"Worthless\" Had to lift bottle off and pour into reservoir. Don't buy. Lowes's was good about taking back. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Bad Unit\" Unit came in quick, well packaged, and looked nice, but it didnt work right. After setting the jug in place, water would only flow for about 3 seconds, then would stop. I tried another jug to see if the seal on the first was the issue, but the 2nd jug did the same thing. I had to lift the jug off the stand to get the trapped air to flow to the jug. I returned it to the store with no problems and no hassle \"Sucks\" All the other complaints x 10. The stream was so week I took the first one back today, what a mess taking 5 gal. water jugs on and off. It was so bad I knew it was broken and explained this to the return folks who were very good about the whole deal. So I bought the same one again, guess what, a flea couldn't take a shower in it's stream. Do not buy, what a waste of time, junk environmentally awful, build things that last and actually work. \"Works great\" When I read the reviews most said the water spout only released so much water. I purchased for my son and once he released some water and removed the water bubbles he hasn't experienced that problem again. \"Leaks\" Started sporadically shooting water out during second bottle. \"Great water dispenser.\" Convenient and easy to clean/maintain dispenser. Affordable. Highly recommend. \"Very slow to dispense.\" This only lets out a stream about 1/4\" and takes forever to fill a pitcher or the coffee pot. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Primo Cooler\" Works well. This is the second one we have had. They last a year or more, and do a great job cooling and heating water. We have no complaints. \"Great Purchase Quality and Value\" Easy set-up and install. Hot or Cold water in an instant. Very easy to use as well. I wish I had one of these at home years ago. Gonna Buy another one for upstairs soon!! \"This thing is great! :)\" I read all these reviews and thought I must be an idoit for still wanting to get this cooler. But I have no regrets, Iv had this cooler for 3 weeks. Most reviews said after 2 weeks it went to crud or after changing the jug it wouldn't stop pouring out so I kept the receipt and the box for all this time to be safe. But no worries! When I went to Lowe's to grab one I had to lay it down in my car, so I was worried that because it laid on its side it might break like everyone else's. So when I got home I set it up and let it stand for about 2 hours before putting the jug on.The water comes out pretty cold, but I don't ever need the hot water function. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Works great!\" I bought this to replace my other one that I loved, and I love this one just as much. It is smaller, too, so it doesn't take up so much room. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"water cooler\" i have wanted one of theses for years , but would never buy one for myself. Ibought this one for my daughters first house she loves it and uses it all the time, when i am over i use and and now will buy one for myself. \"Great water dispenser.\" My daughter had one at her office and the whole staff loved it. The water is cold and the hot is great for making tea. \"Great price\" This cooler works very well and is affordable. Love it! \"dont buy\" I bought this think it was going to be good it was replacing a bottom load from the same company. I read the reviews and figured hey it might be fine. Boy was I wrong within 2 weeks it started leaking. took it back to lowes product was refunded. I was told it cant be exchanged or upgraded. did some looking both top load models lowes sell have the same problem and the company (primo) is aware of it. stay away from the top load spend the extra money and get the bottom load machine save your self the hassle of returning the product. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"I love my cooler\" I bought my cooler over a year ago and also purchased one for my daughter and we both love it. We each had a leak once, but it was due to a tiny hole in the water bottle. I would reccommend this product to a friend. I am even purchasing two for work! \"Primo Water Dispenser\" I am very happy with the product. It is exactly what my wife and I wanted and nothing more. The water is very cold (on the cold side, of course) and the hot water works great for a quick cup of tea. There's not much to say about it really. It is a basic stand alone water dispenser that functions as expected. No bells and whistles. I have not had any problem with leaks. I am only on my 6th or 7th 5 gallon jug. At this point I can't really talk about durability but I don't expect any problems. I recommend this dispenser as a good one to start with. \"Leaks, leaks and leaks!!\" This is the third and last water cooler we will purchase from Primo (Via Lowes) The first water was a bottom loader, the water pump failed a week before the warranty was up. Fortunately Lowes refunded the entire purcahse amount (Thank You Lowes) then we purchased a top loading Primo cooler the same day. It lasted a couple of months before it started leaking (From small hole next to cold water faucet/dispenser) We retuned it, Lowes exchanged it (No questions asked, thank you again!) That was about 6 weeks ago, same problem develops from little hole next to the cold water faucet/dispenser, but this time only when we have the hot water switch on, turn it off and no leaks, but we purchased this product for the hot water feature, not just for cold water. Also Primo says its our bottle...........wrong. We were out of town for 10 days (Unplugged the cooler before we left) Not a drop of water anywhere. Plugged it back in when we returned home (Hot & Cold features turned back on) same problem exists. Will make another return to Lowes tomorrow. \"water dispenser\" i seen lots of negative reviews about his product, so i bought it anyways. so far so good no leaking nothing messed up went through 3 5g bottles and everything is fine. i think that you have some people that don't have a clue on how to treat product or read directions then that leads to broken dispensers, \"Water cooler\" I love this water water cooler! It's stylish & very easy to use! \"Works great\" The spigots just need to be up a little higher but no big deal, other than that it's just fine. \"DO NOT BUY - flooded my kitchen on day 1\" At my household we have had a water cooler for 22 years and I have never have had a problem with the two models I have owned. In 2003 or 2004 I purchased the Primo model #0900172, which I was extremely happy with. I even moved it twice (once out of state) and it kept on going and going and going. Sadly it died last week. Having bought not only the Primo water cooler model #0900172 but also more than 5,000 gallons of drinking water over the last decade, I considered myself a customer of Primo.Not a minute longer.In my search to replace the water cooler I checked out Primo water coolers, what else? After all I had thought highly of the company. Turns out the majority of the models are black/stainless. That should have been the first clue that something is wrong at Primo. Have Primo's designers been in any kitchens lately? Lots of people have white appliances, including me. I am not going to put a black/stainless water cooler next to my white refrigerator.Thus, my only option was model 601141, which looks like made from cheap plastic. Reading the reviews at Lowe's website I noticed that a lot of reviews complained that the water cooler did not last very long. Having no other option I purchased model #601141, plus an extended warranty for 2 years.As I unpacked the water cooler at home I noticed that the package included a coupon that expired in 6/2014. That too should have been another warning sign. I set up the water cooler and luckily put it on a boot tray. About an hour after that I drank a glass of cold water. The cold water dispenser worked fine. Later in the evening I wanted to fix myself a cup of tea.I pressed the lever and filled my tea cup, then released my index finger, but the hot water button was stuck and about one gallon of hot water spilled out on the floor. I had to find a sharp instrument to push it out of its position and up again. My new floor (1 year old) got flooded. Please note that the picture shows only a bit of the water on the boot tray. That's because the water came out with so much force that it spilled way beyond the boot tray. Luckily it did not burn my feet because it wearing house shoes.That's it – Primo “good bye”. My best guess is that Primo is well aware that this model is a cheap model, which causes many customers problems. A company, who is concerned about its reputation would have recalled the water coolers and checked what the problem is. However, it appears that Primo does not care but simply lets the customer test if the water cooler is ok or not, and if a customer's floor is getting flooded like mine, so be it.Since the coupon was valid from 2013 to 2014 there would have been ample time to recall that model and put out something better.Also, how about creating more options – white, stainless, and black water coolers? An appliance is supposed to fit to other appliances.And what's with that clip bracket? A water cooler is supposed to be a free standing appliance. Plus, the water cooler makes a weird noise, which may be normal but since this one is made from cheap plastic I can hear it, whereas I never did when I owned model 900172.These days my household consumes ½ gallon water per day, which adds up to 180 gallons per year. That's lost business for Primo. I cannot take the risk of encountering more inconveniences. Saving on production costs at the expense of loyal customers is not a good idea. Good bye. \"Cheap and Effective Model\" I had just got this water cooler. I have seen many before, but I have never installed one before. Within minutes, I had figured out how to use it. This is a very affordable water cooler and it is very durable. I most definitely will be buying more products from this manufacturer! \"Disappointed\" Had the unit for 11 months loves it until we replaced a 5 gallon water jug and by morning empty .5 Gallo,a of water in our carpet. Continued to empty unit and plenty of water in cold side but hit was empty so problem was hot water side. \"Great Unit!\" I purchased this unit because I was tired of amassing a giant pile of empty plastic water bottles. It works fabulously with the hot and cold water. \"$99.00 - 10% + tax = Happiness !\" I got a 10% discount coupon from Lowes and wanted a water cooler!After looking at all Primo models and realized that all of them have the same guts. In other words all models have the same mechanics (compressor, heater, etc.) only the outside is different,I chose the least expensive at $99.00, (I guess people rate looks not performance)After running for 12 hours the cold water temperature was 41.2F and Hot 174.3F (measured with my infrared thermometer).End result $99.00-10%+tax=Happiness! \"Great product so far\" Bought this a couple of weeks ago to replace our old one from around 2005. Energy Star, bright white plastic, easy push button controls, can't get much better than this. \"A Primo Selection\" Works as described in the product description. Very pleased with the unit. \"Water Cooler\" I love my new water cooler, also has a hot feature for making a cup of tea. Love that I can turn off the hot button when it's not in use. I recommend this cooler. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Excellent water cooler\" We looked at numerous water coolers and this one did everything we needed and at a cheaper price. \"Unit began to heat up\" Purchased the unit in October 2016 and the unit only made it 9 months. Unit started to get hot and leak water everywhere and luckily I caught it in time. Called the company and they are replacing it because it falls under the one year factory warranty. Funny thing is when I called and explained what happened primo barely wanted to know what caused it. All the company said was it falls under the one year factory replacement warranty and they will be sending me a new one. I asked what to do with the old one and primo said to discard/throw it away. I just thought that was crazy. Who wouldn't you want to know what happened to the old unit or at least in inspect it!!! Must happen way to often!!! \"Defective twice\" bought set up is easy. put the water jug on started leaking cold water from a hole to the right of the cold water spout. i think it might be a air hole. carpet is soaked. then it started leakig hot water. returned got different on. guess what yep same thing. returning today. i will give props the water is cold and hot on the other side. \"Water was not as cold as old one.\" prefer the metal tank units. They have colder water.Unit rturned. \"Water dispenser\" For the price and basic funtion this is good buy. Keeps water cold and the hot water is really convenient. n/a hot water stopped working 2 months after I purchased it... less than a year later I came home yesterday my floor was soaked... all the water leaked out from the bottom not buying Primo anymore all made in China! \"Excellant Water Cooler\" We purchased this water cooler for our vacation property and love it entirely. It's very easy to set up, and works like a charm. The only thing that we would change on it is that there be a 'room temperature' tap rather than just a hot water and cold water taps. (But that's really nit-picking because we knew that when we bought the unit.) Suffice it to say that we are very happy with the purchase and pleased with the unit's performance! \"It works great!\" Wonderful switches in the back lets you turn on/off cold/hot temperature. \"Poor Quality\" If I had the box, I would return this item. Once you release the button..whether it is hot or cold, water continues to pour out. Made of cheap plastic and very light and tippy. Even though there is a wall support Not interested in putting a hole in my wall. The buttons do not light up. The measurement from the actual spout to water catch tray isn't very large, nor does it have good depth. So forget about fitting anything under it except a med. water glass. Disappointed. Do not waste money on this product. \"Water cooler\" This water cooler is perfect for standing around and chatting with my roommates while we sip ice cold water in Arizona. Worked out exactly as anticipated! \"Leaking Water Cooler\" Purchased a Primo water cooler just like the other review. Worked great, but it kept leaking and getting the wood floors wet. Returned the unit and the replacement did the same thing. Primo support said I had leaking bottles which I did not. Then they said the over flow needed to be drained (includes completely draining the bottle). Must do this every time it is overfilled. Turns out that when flipping the bottle to place it on the cooler, you run the risk of overfilling the tank, which causes the leak. This cooler only works with bottles, that have a seal to puncture (bottle service usually). DO NOT USE this cooler if you use your own bottles. If you do, you will have wet floors. I returned the second unit for another brand that works with my bottles. \"Save time do not purchas\" Purchased this in Feb 2015 with 2 year protection plan worked well for 4 months then after replacing a new bottle and hour later hear dripping noise in kitchen found half the 5 gallon water bottle leaking on floor. Removed bottle emptied bottle and emptied resivoir replaced bottle and all was ok for another 2 months. Then after. Replacing another new bottle in early evening found the next morning water all over kitchen floor and bottle 3/4 full inspecting this I found same issue others had with water coming out of vent hole near cold water tap. I returned it and got the same a replacement agiain in early evening only to find this new one doing the same leaking the next morning. Well took it back to Lowes next day this time upgrading to a bottom load cooler. Purchased another 2 year warrant as I found out it only covers one time replacement, will see how long the bottom load one holds up now. Don't buy one without the warranty it does help. \"Great Little Unit!\" Maybe I am writing this too soon but have had the unit just 2 hours and it does not leak and works great. It doesn't have bells and whistles as other units do but who needs them anyway? I registered online and if anything happens I can get it replaced. I don't know what people want for $99. I like the feature in the back that allows me to turn off either hot or cold water or both. Of course I could just pull the plug!So far I am happy with it. I would recommend it. If you want a thermostat, clock and lights...buy something else. \"Not good\" I did not do any research about the product since It is not some complicate product. it is easier to put together, I had same issue as the first review. I bought yesterday , but I will return the product tomorrow, n/a I purchased this in December of 2013. It boiled the water in the 5 gallon bottle in April 2014. I exchanged it but 8 week later the cold water no longer works. Got a refund and am looking for a new cooler. This is a bad one so look out. \"Will leak and ruin your floor!\" This is a terrible cooler, avoid it at all costs! I've actually been through 2 of them so far. The first one lasted about 6 months. I took the top bottle receptacle off to clean it and when everything was put back together, it leaked out an entire 5 gallon bottle. I thought maybe I didn't put something back together right, so I went and purchased a new one. Well that one leaked after the third bottle change. Again, it was the same thing, the entire, full 5 gallon bottle leaked out and ruined my floor. And this was from a unit which was barely 3 weeks old. Obviously there is a design flaw. I use the primo brand water bottles, and always exchange them at Lowes, so the problem can't be blamed on an off-brand bottle or a self-refill job. Do not waste your money on this piece of junk, unless you like floods! \"Great product!\" We like this water cooler so much, we bought another! I love turning the heat option on and off. Our first primo water cooler lasted 7 years before we gave it to a friend. Impressed! \"Cold hot water cooler\" We are very pleased with this purchase. We are also finding we are drinking a LOT more water with it. It was very easy to set up and looks nice in the kitchen. It did not take but a few minutes for the water to be cold and/or hot. My daughter always has one in her kitchen and we are very happy to have one too. \"Worked Great...Until I Attached the Second Bottle\" We loved our water cooler for the first few days. The water was as promised -hot or cold-depending on the tap you used. Liked the safety lockout on the hot water as it prevented a sleepy surprise one early morning. But when we used up our first five-gallon bottle and made a bottle change, the water cooler had a tiny little drip from the side of the cold water tap. We thought it must have run down the pipe after we exchanged the water bottles.We were wrong. When my wife went back to get a drink a couple of hours later, the cooler had leaked more than half of the five-gallon bottle into the floor. She pulled the bottle off and quickly emptied the cooler. When I got home, we carefully looked the unit over to see if there was something we'd done wrong. After not finding anything according to the checklist for leaks, we carefully put a new bottle back to replace the one that had leaked. Everything looked fine...for a couple of hours. Then, I found myself mopping up even more water.I returned the cooler to Lowes and exchanged it for one of the twice-as-expensive units with the water bottle underneath the machine.24 hours later, it's working like a champ and we're getting the great hot and/or cold water we expected -with no problems. The manufacturer calls the top loading unit their \"Best Value\" for the money, and I hope ours was one of the units that every company has that fails. They are terrific products -and we are still fans. Just wanted everyone to be aware that the top-load units might not be the best way to go. \"Not Happy with How Long It Worked\" We bought one of these Primo water coolers six years ago and it would not cool when we tried to use it. We returned it and the replacement unit stopped cooling and started leaking around the top collar after three years of use in our kitchen. We bought another Primo water cooler, which I believe was the same model, and it also stopped cooling and developed a leak around the top collar after about three years. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \".....WATER SPILLAGE....\" ....THIS COOLER WAS \"ONLY\" PURCHASED ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF A SALESMAN AT LOWES....TRY INSERTING A 5 GALLON BOTTLE OF WATER....AT THE VERY LEAST YOU WILL NEED A LARGE TOWEL TO CLEAN UP THE SPILLAGE....I HAVE OWNED THIS MODEL FOR 1 1/2 YEARS AND CLEAN WATER EVERY TIME...WE HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING BUT SPILLAGE ALWAYS OCCURS....I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE REQUESTED A SALESMAN WITH A SECOND OPINION.....!!!! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Horrible water dispenser\" This was a great product for a while, then while we weren't home, the motor burned up. We were lucky just the dispensers was burned, not my home \"cold water valve leaks by\" Bought little over a year ago. Don't use often. Cold water valve already passing. Pan overflows in less than a day. Makes a mess. I wish I would have read reviews before buying. Beware of this poor quality dispenser. \"leaks\" We bought one a year ago and it started leaking from the bottom after about 10 months. We decided to buy a second one and we got it and this one leaked immediately not only from the bottom but in the front as well. Returned it and won't buy another one. \"Good for the price\" Good dispenser for the price. Convenient hot water dispenser so you never have to wait for hot water.

Really awful customer support. Do not buy this unit, it is a waste of money. \"Just what we were looking for\" It works great! There is really nothing to put together. It is quiet. We are really happy with it. \"Great Alternative to Buying Bottled Water every we\" We bought this water cooler back in 2012. It has paid for itself many times over!! We've been very pleased with it and had no problems until a few days ago. My boyfriend noticed a puddle on the floor and both the dispenser and water jug were extremely hot. We think that maybe the hot water part shorted out. The recent negative reviews make me wonder if this is still a worthwhile product. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. 2 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern Love it...

The unit leaks slow thru the hot side when turned on- Returned back-Will not purchase or recommend-n Does what it should. Works as it should. Dispenses water like I've never seen before.n Not a great product....many issues that seems ridiculous Motor is loud when pushing up water to reserve tank.Hot water is not available at all times. There is a button you push first, then must wait maybe 5 minutes. We use 5 Gallon Water Bottles. This machine only uses 3/4\" of the water then will shut off. You have to put a new 5 gallon bottle in, save the 1/4 left from the other bottle, then wait till the new bottle is reduced enough to add in the 1/4 balance from old bottle. Yup, pain the in major butt.n Great Product The water dispenser works just great. It was so simple to get set up and started working immediately.n You've got to try this dispenser it's great. work's great. we enjoy having hot or cold water any time we want!n Excellent water dispenser unit There's not much to be said about this product other than it's a great water dispenser unit. For those folks who have questionable water supplies or just need an extra source of fresh water in the house, this is a great item. n The look of this unit is pretty sleek. Black and stainless steel go great and the unit has a fairly small footprint so there's no need to worry about this thing taking up a whole lot of space in your kitchen/office/etc. n Setup is breeze. It takes your standard 5 gallon water bottles so you can purchase those anywhere. SImply plug the unit in, attach the siphon (probably want to give it a good wipe down first) to the water jug and slide it in the unit. And since this is a bottom load unit, SOOOOO much easier to handle as opposed to the older top load units. Plus it's a lot easier on the back. Once you load the bottle in, there may be some noises coming from the unit which is normal. It can be loud depending on your tolerance but nothing out of the ordinary for me. Water is chilled pretty quickly however the hot water can take some time. n For extra piece of mind (as far as fresh water is concerned) having a unit like this is almost imperative IMO. With the relative ease and maintenance of this unit, plus the added benefit of additional drinkable water, I think this is a great add-on for your house/kitchen.nRead Less Missed the Mark Loud and takes a while to heat up. The water never fully leaves the bottle and the room temp water is a joke. I did better with my 75.00 Black and Decker modeln Not drinking city water anymore. When we first moved into out home, I knew the city water was no good. There is so much calcium in it, that it would actually crystalize in the back if our toilets, and plug up our faucets. I really did not look forward to passing a kidney stone the size of a grapefruit, so we purchased this. Even with the filter on our refrigerator, we could definitely tell a major difference in the water quality of the spring water that we bought for this, and the city water we were drinking. Home Depot sells the water jugs for around $6 (after purchase of the first jug whiz is about $14. Then you just exchange them for a new one each time. I love that it's a bottom feed, and that the jug is completely hidden. It's not loud at all, and the hot water only takes about 2 minutes to get smoking hot. We are so happy that we decided to get this water dispenser, and will feel much better about the water we drink.nRead Less Great item This has been a fantastic item so far. I used to have a top loader. However, with age, this became more difficult to use. Now, I just slide the bottle right in. The only function I've used on it is the cold water. So, I can't speak to the heated water or the room temperature water. But I have no reason to believe that there would be any problem with either of these functions. I think this was a great purchase.n Nice buy Nice buy,I like the fact that the water bottle is hidden .n Dispenser Works really good easy to use and easy to load the water bottlen Great Product I purchased this water dispenser about a month ago and dispensed a little over 10 gallons of water through it.It does make a little noise when it pumps the water into the reservoir, but it's only for a minute at first to fill; then for seconds when refilling. I had to adjust the temperature setting a couple times to get the water as cold as I like. It's perfect chill every time. I haven't used the hot water, I tested it when first purchased and you have to wait a minute for it to heat up, but comes out very hot.I like the design, the dispensing buttons on top, the lights, and the best is not having to flip the jugs on top of the dispenser.I don't have any cons yet, only purchased a month ago so hopefully none will arise.nRead Less It looks really nice... I seasoned it.. but took ten gallons to get the smell of plastic out...which is normal. I let the unit sit upright as recommended...except I left it for couple days before installing(just to be sure). The first thing I noticed was how loud it was when filling tank from bottom, which is after a full glass of water(not good when u have a newborn). Then I didnt like the waiting for water to heat..I could stovetop it faster. Then we noticed the water wasnt cold enough, so we adjusted the unit to go colder. About one month after I got so tired of hearing it click on, then keep clicking(compressor). Too loud! Then the unit stopped cooling alltogether about four months..luckily hd has an awesome rtn policy...maybe I just got a lemon, but Im going to a different brand.nRead Less lasted less than 1 year I bought this online about 9 months ago from Home Depot. It worked fine during that time. However it stopped working today for no apparent reason. Dissapointed have to go buy another one this soon. No i cannot recommend.n Didn't work out of the box That's not exactly right, the hot water did work briefly (less than a day), but quickly stopped. Having to return.n great dispenser Great dispenser , very easy to load and looks really goodn Love it!!! It is a bit noisier than a top fill cooler. The pump pulls the water back up to the refill housing for dispensing, thus the noise. However, with that said, it is much easier, to place a refill bottle full of water, in the bottom compartment than lifting on a top fed cooler!!n Good Purchase so far Bought this for my mother in law for christmas, she loves it.n Glacier Bay Water Dispenser Nice looking water dispenser, looks great with my other stainless appliances. Only had it for a few weeks so far, however, room temp water comes out as cold as cold water and motor is a little noisy when it runs. Hot water takes a few minutes to heat up, my other dispenser had hot water on demand; for me tho, it is not a deal breaker.n Glacier Bay H2O water dispenser The dispenser works as advertised. The stainless steel suction pipe is very sturdy and doesn't leave metallic taste on the dispensed water. We hardly use the hot water function except in the morning for tea and coffee. All in all; a good buy for the money.n water dispenser Easy to set-up works great as well as looks good in homen Bottom Load Water Dispenser in Stainless Steel This cooler is nice looking, a little noisy at times, but I like the fact that you don't have to have an ugly water bottle on top. Also it's nice since I'm getting a little older and don't have to lift 40 pounds of water over my head to refill it. It's a little more than I wanted to pay but so far it is worth it.n Works Great! The cooler was very easy to set up and works great. It looks nice too! The only issue we have with it is that the 3 gallon bottle we purchased is too big and the pump device does not sit all the way in the bottle but it does work great anyhow.n great product I just set up the dispenser and was quite easy setup.. Looks great the only slight problem is the noise the motor makes sometimes.. You shouldn't be too concerned and the price is about right for the quality. The other models dont look so nice and look fragile...n Very pleased, ices up too easily though We got this for my AARP-card-carrying parents. I won't go so far as to call them elderly yet... but they're at an age when lifting a 5 gallon jug of water over their shoulders is an activity we should frown upon. This is a bottom load dispenser which means there is a trap door on the bottom (the stainless steel part), which opens to reveal the water jug and dip tube. To replace it, all they have to do is push a new jug into the trap door (no lifting required), and drop the dip tube down into the bottle.n It has a \"holding tank\" on the top. It pumps water up to the top section where it has a small reservoir of heated and cooled water (a glass or two of each). When you pour a glass it turns on a small pump to suck water out of the jug and up to the reservoir. Neither myself or my parents found the noise particularly annoying or loud as other reviewers indicated. It doesn't run the pump all the time, only after water has been poured.n The heater works well, but requires a 30 seconds wait period to take it from luke warm to \"hot tea\" temps. The cooler on the other hand, gave us a lot of trouble. At first we thought it was broken because it wouldn't dispense cool water... only room temperature. We realized (after a small puddle formed) that the cooling system had iced over and wasn't making cold water. We played with the temperature knobs a little and found a happy medium where it dispenses cold water and doesn't ice up... but it was like cracking a safe to dial that knob in just right. That said, it was a one time annoyance. Now that everything is dialed in it has been running fine.n All around, a fantastic replacement for the traditional gravity systems that require lifting the water jug up.nRead Less As advertised The instructions clearly state to place the newly arrived unit upright for 12 hours before plugging it in. This is very true to allow the refrigerant to settle into the bottom of the unit at the compressor. I did not notice this instruction and attempted to start the unit without doing so. It did not work and I re-read the instructions.n I did unplug the unit over night and then re-started it the next morning and it operated as it should have.n Decent Water Cooler with Quirks I wanted a bottom loading water dispenser since I have difficulty flipping those 5 gallon bottles. In doing research, there are really only 4 manufacturers of these things. The Glacier Bay unit is actually made by Greenway and also sold under the Vitapur label. I've waited a month since purchasing the unit to write this review.n The other bottom loaders use a plastic straw to suck the water into the dispenser, while this model uses a metal one. I believe, long term, the metal straw is a better choice. The bottles I use are 5 gallons with a handle, so I have to set the straw length for 4 gallons rather than 5, but the straw rests on the bottom of the bottle and as I've measured the residual in the 5 bottles I've used so far, never has it left more than 1/4 cup of water.n The \"kettle\" feature, rather than a constant hot water supply was a plus in my opinion since I wasn't terribly interested in hot water dispensing, but being able to heat some up as needed is nice- It gets hot enough to make a Cup o Noodles or coffee/tea. Also, most of the other brands have problems with their hot water tanks leaking. I haven't actually notice a temperature difference between the \"cold\" and \"room temperature\" buttons, so take that under advisement.n Noise wise, the unit makes moderate noise when the pump is pulling water into the reservoir. It can be for up to a minute when the bottle is nearly empty and it starts running after you've dispensed about 10 ounces of water . There really isn't a way to make it quieter as all pumps make a bit of noise when operating, and sound deadening material would act as insulation meaning it could overheat.n The cooling compressor is quieter than my refrigerator, but seems to run for an inordinately long time. I rarely see the optimal cold temperature light turned on for my machine.n Performance wise, it is a water cooler. I mark them down for the overpowering blue lights on the front- why does the name need to be light all the time? A night light switch would have been nice.n I also wish the filling area was concave to allow a more stable surface when filling. Making the drip pan removable would have been nice instead of having to lift the entire door panel for draining.n Complaints:The door design. It's not a door, it's a panel held on with magnets. Yes, it makes loading bottles easier (especially with the ramped bottom) but extension hinges would have accomplished the same thing.n Also, the \"cap\" and straw have this large handle- it serves no purpose. It doesn't lock the cap onto the bottles- so why all the excess metal?nRead Less Great item Overall great water dispenser. I enjoy that it's a bottom loader rather than the top. The nozzle allows you to extend or retract to the size of water container you put inside. The magnetic door is nice so you can remove the entire front door to make it easier for loading bigger water containers. The price is a little more than I wanted to pay but overall I'm satisfied with my product.n Water dispenser Very happy with it. Water stays very cold. No leakage. Easy to clean. Grandchildren use it with no accidents.n Great for Home or Office I've used this Glacier Bay Bottom Load Water Dispenser for a little over a month now. Beyond unpacking it, there really is no setup besides adding the water bottle. The unit itself looks very nice and will fit well in a nice kitchen or office. The stainless steel appears to as good of quality as any appliance in my kitchen.n This dispenser has a number of features I like. Loading a water bottle in a top load dispenser would not be an issue for me but I simply like having the bottle out of sight. The kettle feature (which provides the hot water) is only turned on when you need it. This is what makes this an Energy Star rated product. There is also a safety feature for the hot water dispenser button. It's nothing complicated but should prevent a small child from inadvertently dispensing hot water. I like the blue LED above the dispenser area. It is a tad bright but it's not an issue for us.n The main compliant I've seen in other reviews is the noise. I will say that you clearly know when the pump is filling the reservoir but it runs for 30 seconds at best. I personally don't think it is loud. I have no cons to report, in fact this dispenser has worked perfectly for me. Add to that the savings of buying bottle water in bulk, and I would say this is a great buy.nRead Less Has helped me drink more water This Bottom Load Water Dispenser has helped me drink more water. The convenience of nice cold water was the key. The bottom load is nice, it hides the 5 gallon jug and makes changing out very easy.There is some noise that it makes but that is to be expected because of the refrigeration of the water that is taking place.The hot water is not constant it takes about three minutes for it to heat up which is no big deal. By not having the water stay hot 100 percent of the time saves energy.Great cooler I would definitely recommend getting.n Set up very easy.

Seems that everyone has the same issues. Had for a little under two years, replacing one that was 7 years old (different brand). Worked fine but didn't like how slowly the water came out. Also, having to wait 2 to 3 minutes for hot water negates the reason for having. Easier to use microwave when you want hot water for coffee or oatmeal.

My only real complaint is that the product had a short lifespan of only about two years. The failure seems to be from a bad compressor.

My 13 year old dispenser finally gave up. I am discovering that nowadays they mostly make HOT & COLD ones. Was so happy to find this dispenser on the HD website and for such good price. Was ready to jump in my car.But first I red the 1 star comments. And there it was! No room temperature water. The vender answered with an apology: mistake in the description. Should not be so hard to change that on your website.n glacier bay water dispenser this unit work 2 years and after it stop cooling. we try to replace it on warannty.at home depot they told us that the warannty was one year and that's all. we try to make it repair by the company... no way.n we bought an other place and another company.n Set up procedure is bad The set up cleaning process in the manual needs to be updated. You find this out if you call them. After adding the vinegar you get no flow from the hat water valve. My first reaction was bad valve, return the unit. called the number provided and it was explained that at this point there id not enough water to reach the hot valve. Continued with setup, it takes at least 2 gallons of water to get the vinegar taste out because the hot side has not been drained. I would rate the unit much higher if I knew about this when I started. As I said I almost returned it.n Junk Leaked and stopped cooling water after 10 months. HD should be ashamed. So should Glacier Bay. So should China.n Don't recommend We don't recommend this product because it only lasted two years for us. The cold water feature no longer cools the water. We used to have a Sunbeam that lasted for years and was still working when we sold it at our yard sale. We only sold it to get another to match our new stove and refrigerator. I regret that. It also did not seem to cool the water as well as our old one.n The water dispenser The water dispenser was received in good shape. Only took a few minutes to install. hot and cold water heated and chilled properly, no issues. our employees love the fact that the water is filtered.n QUICK DELIVERY, EASY SET SINCE REPLACING!

We use to have a drinking fountain that wasn't used. People would come to the pool with their own isolated containers and no way to refill them while at the pool. The Avaion Water Cooler is the answer. We have received a number of positive responses for this in place of the drinking fountain. The unit looks nice and is holding up well. The only complaint is the cost of the replacement filters. So far this hasn't been a big deal. All in all this is a well made unit and is working well for our community's needs. Well worth 4 stars.n Bottleless Water Cooler This answered my dreams! We used to live on well water and always had bottled water delivered, so got used to having hot and ice cold water always available. When we moved to a place with city water I really missed the convenience of having hot and cold water at the tip of my fingers. I hate having to heat water for my tea and wouldn't dream of microwaving it, which changes the taste, so having hot water available is great! Didn't want the hassle of water delivery or storing the bottles either. My husband hooked this up in about 20-30 minutes and I have been joyful since.n Easy setup.

I recently connected the Avalon hot/cold water dispenser in the office where I work so that I could get feedback from more people. It is connected next to the water fountain that we have been using for a number of years. Installation was actually easier than I expected. The in-line valve fit the present connections perfectly and there were no leaks detected. After the water heater indicator light turned off, I tested the water temperature and found it to be about 180 degrees. The cold water was also fine at 40-45 degrees. The water does come out a little slow, but that is likely because of the filter. After dispensing water, the valve turns on and re-fills the tank for a few seconds, making a little noise. The compressor for the cold water makes a little noise when it first starts and then it is very quiet. The safety button on the hot water dispenser works fine. The cold water tasted good with no odd flavors or odors. The instructions were not horrible with only about about 7 misspelled words. Not sure why this still happens since spell check. One section that I could not figure out was \"If the appliance is making a soud, there should be leakage. Please check the PCB on the palte. Repair machine and dry the PCB, and then power on agin.\" What?? Also, Self-Cleaning is a little misleading considering the elaborate cleaning process described in the user manual although there is a weekly self-cleaning process using ozone that is used to sanitize the lines and tank and only requires the push of a button.nRead Less Great product and very beautiful Great product and very beautifuln After I finished its setup.

The replacement filters are a bit costly but they do last at least a year,although they recommend replacing them every six months. The only thing that I am experiencing problems with is the low flow of the room temperature water. It starts flowing good, but after a cup and half it drops down sharply. I have contacted customer support and followed their trouble shooting steps, but all seems fine. In order for me fill anything larger than a cup, I have to depress both the room temperature and the cold buttons at the same time. Also, the LED light is a good idea but not very bright. It could be brighter since the unit is black in color in the dispensing area. The dispensing buttons on the top are a very good idea. I am still considering keeping it. Other than that it's a good unit.nRead Less So far it works great, everyone is please. Three people... So far it works great, everyone is please. Three people said they would buy them for home.

No More wasted water bottles and carrying cases of water. So much savings and less waste.n Does what it's supposed to Hot and cold water in the shop is what we needed, this unit does that. No more, no less. The cold water isn't ice-cold, but it's better than room temp and about what you'd get out of a pitcher in the fridge. The hot won't cook your ramen noodles, but will make a cup of freeze-dried coffee without too much coaxing. Not boiling, but hot enough for most uses.n Not what I expected The water is not ice cold and you cannot fill a large drinking glass because not enough space.n It's perfect for the price...nice quality, looks nice and works beautifully! It's perfect for the price...nice quality, looks nice and works beautifully!n Not recommended I have always wanted a hot/cold water dispenser for my kitchen. This model is not too big or too small for my kitchen.n It worked out of the box but the manual is not professional and needs to be updated the unit is really poorly designed.n  My only problem with the dispenser buttons is that they are very tough to push and hold while filling and I have actually had my finger pinched once when releasing the hot water button. It hurts and I got a bad wound.n Better options out there It works, but for the price, not so much. Every time you need to replace the cooler, there isn't a big enough reservoir to catch the spill off and water goes everywhere. Not beneficial to someone that has to buy their drinking water and can't drink tap water.n I bought this water dispenser to replace a Primo unit. This unit works well to dispense cool wate... I bought this water dispenser to replace a Primo unit. This unit works well to dispense cool water, but the compressor hums much more loudly than the Primo did and is much louder than our refrigerator. I set the thermostat to the lowest setting so we wouldn't have to listen to this noise so much. Also, the Primo unit had a switchable light to illuminate the glass fill area and this Glacier Bay unit does not.n Too Loud Bought this product to use when my well was condemned and was waiting for a new well to be drilled. The dispenser does a good job of keeping water cold and hot and ready to drink. The problem is the cooler is extremely loud. This machine is as loud as the basement jet pump when the compressor is running. When the cooler comes on at night, it is loud enough to wake my young children. As soon as I get the new well, this will go straight to the barn where the chickens will have to deal with the noise. n It does stay cold and the instant hot water is nice to have for making tea, but the noise is not worth the convenience. n I would not recommend this product.n DID not last I purchased this on 8/9/16 and the hot water dispenser does not dispense. I was leary about the Brand. I had a Whirlpool prior to this thing and it lasted over 20+ years. Never again.n Works Great -- Compact Design The Glacier Bay Water Cooler has several great features and works wonderfully. This unit has a clean and compact design, which takes up little room, no matter where you place it. The cooler has good water pressure, which is delivered in a steady stream. The unit is extremely quite and has the ability to cool as well as heat water. It even has indication lights on the front, blue for the cooled water and red for the hot water, which lets you know when it has reached itu2019s desired temperature. n On the back of the water cooler, along the right side, you will see a series of knobs and switches (refer to the fourth picture). Just be aware that these locations donu2019t match the diagram provided. The top knob is the fuse for the unit, which you don't have to do anything with. The second is a red toggle switch. This switch controls whether or not you would like to turn on the hot water feature. The third area is used to adjust how cold you would like the water to be when it is dispensed. This is done by taking a flat head screwdriver and turning the lever until you reach the desired temperature. n You don't have to worry about your little ones getting scolded with hot water either. Not only do you have the option to not turn it on, via the switch in the back, but it also has an additional safety feature. In order to use the hot water you have to push down a red tab, which is located on the side of the hot water button, before the button will depress and dispense the water. n The only thing that I will warn you about is during the initial cleaning phase. You have to remove the water bottle support collar. It is tight and can be difficult to remove. Keep applying steady pressure and before long it will begin to move. Don't use any tools, because you could damage the unit.nRead Less Very Nice This product has everything we needed. Hot/cold water, fits into a small space, child safety for the hot water button. The only con is that the water dispenses too slow but because of the value/cost it more than makes up for this issue.n Dollhouse water cooler! You may want to sit down to fill a cup as the machine is very low to the ground and water simply trickles out of this machine.n Not wanting to beat a dead horse, but.... There are a ton of pictures of this product, and pretty much goes for the features of this dispenser, so I'm not going to beat a dead horse, but this thing is great. I live in the Youngstown, OH area, and lets just say that the water quality is (NOT GREAT!), so we try not to drink it if we can help it. We already have a dispenser in the kitchen, but I wanted one for the garage as it has been extremely hot, and I have been drinking way to much soda to keep cool. n When it arrived, I took it out of the box, placed it in the corner, and put the 5 gal water jug on. Within a few minutes, the water got extremely hot, and a few after that, it was extremely cold. n As for function, its quiet, works well, easy to use, has lights that help indicate which side is which and the water taste 100% better. My kids are drinking more water not that I have this in the garage, and since my garage is heated, I can keep it out there in the winter and make hot chocolate while working. n All in all, its not the most high class looking water dispenser, but it will work with most any décor, but most importantly, its functional and my kids are drinking way less sugar water because off that.nRead Less Not happy The hot water doesn't work I'm not happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'nnnnnnnn Child safe I got this for our church. We put it in the childrenu2019s ministry. Those who serve can have cold water on the hot days and come winter if it gets cooler they can have Hot tea or even Hot coco. The best feature no worries of the children getting the hot water on them. You can only access the hot water by pushing in the red tab on the side of the hot water button then depressing it to dispense your hot water, really safe for the children. Helps them get in the habit of drinking good water instead of all the sodas for a healthier future. Perfect for the home, office work shop or any place you may have a need for hot and cold bottled watern Cold glass of water anyone? Very nice water cooler for just the right price. This is a smaller more compact water cooler that can hole 3 or 5 gallon jugs of water. The compact design of this water cooler can be a great thing or it can be a bad thing. It is great if you have limited space as it does not take up as much room as many other water coolers, but the compact design also means that the water outlets are lower and you will need to bend over further to reach them. Not so great for elderly or anyone with back problems. n The hot water heater can be switched on and off. The temperature can also be adjusted and it heats the water quite quickly. I personally leave the hot water heater switched off as I have no need for it and it is the part of the cooler that used most of the electricity. The water isnt boiling hot but it is hot enough for things like hot chocolate and tea. The cooler incorporates a safety on the hot water button which makes it more difficult for young kids to tamper with which is a nice feature. The cold water takes longer to cool than the hot water takes to heat. The cooler has indicators on the front that light when the water is at optimal temperatures. To me the cool water comes out at a great temperature. Its plenty cold enough, but not ice cold. n The setup of the cooler is fairly straight forward. The cooler comes fully assembled. The directions for setup and cleaning are pictures only. The lack of a word description along with the pictures makes them a bit difficult to understand but the setup is fairly easy. When you first unpack the cooler. If you had the cooler laying on it side at any point you want to leave the cooler in an upright position for at least 12 hours before using. This is normal procedure for anything that uses refrigerant. It is advised to do an initial cleaning of the cooler before you use it. You clean the cooler the same way you clean your coffee machine. By flushing it with water and vinegar. This will get rid of the plastic taste that can introduce itself into your water from a new machine. Even if the water and vinegar does not completely get rid of the taste of plastic. Its absolutely normal as with any new machine and the taste will go away over time and use. n All in all. I really like this cooler. I would have a preferred it to be black and stainless steal like the rest of my kitchen appliances, but that is just me. Some people will love the white because they have white appliances. I would also have preferred for the water to dispense a little faster but it dispenses fast enough.The cooler functions quite nicely and you will be hard pressed to find a better one as modern looking as this one in the same price range.nRead Less Works good Works great it's a lil short but what u going to do I go a 2 and 4 year old my 2 year old can't push the water button down witch is a good thing I think but saves me 49 a month with the water delivery so it's great always cold and it's not even all the way on cold good product for the pricen Easy to Use This is a light end model of water dispensers but one of the best features is the dual spigots. Top loading models have the disadvantage of being heavy to load but use gravity to feed the well. I like that you can adjust the thermostat for the cold water to either keep it chilled or really cold. Hot water stays on all the time so there is never a waiting period.n Great dispenser Despite all of the negative reviews, and being a bit skeptical when the unit arrived, I myself am quite pleased with this hot and cold water dispenser. It will accept three or five gallon size jugs.The water can be purchased at my local home depot for about thirteen dollars on initial purchase then it's about half of that when you return the jug for a replacement. That saves money- Even if you purchase the twenty four packs of water at your local grocery store, those savings still don't compare going this route.As for the cooler itself, it dispense hot and cold water. There is a thermostat control on the back for the cold water, and an on/off switch for the hot water. Child resistant safety switch on the front for the hot water. It's compact and easy to use. Overall a great water dispenser.nRead Less NO instant hot water - even though they make it...

Like others reviewing this dispenser, mine too now leaks after only 90 days of use. A slow consistent dribble of water forms a small puddle of water at the base of the unit. It's the perfect water supply if you have a free roaming indoor hamster or even small dog that likes to lap up from the puddles. However if you're a human who prefers their water supply contained and doesn't like their floors damaged, this is not the dispenser I would recommend.n Water leaking Setup dispenser in the evening and woke up the next morning to about 1/2 gallon on the floor.

I absolutely love it!n wire buring smell Bought it in April 2016. 4 month into use, when turn hot water on, there is a wire burning smell. n Also don't like the design that every time using hot water have to push the button and wait for few minutes.

My kids drink more water now since I bought it.I'm glad that they came out with the hot and cold water dispensern junk Like others this unit looks nice and worked great till about 6 months of use it died and stop making cold water called HD and they said theres nothing they can do about it thanks home depotn Misleading product info. The products description says room temp water but doesn't actually have that option. Also you have to wait 3 minutes for hot water.n Disappointing water flow, not worth it Slowest dispenser you'll ever buy. I wait about a minute for a large cup to fill up. So frustrating. Do not buy.n Not Good!! Home Depot shouldn't be aloud to sell this product! Ya it's nice at first, until the warranty is up! Then goes out on you! Taking my business somewhere else! Stopped getting cold and when you switch out bottles, water goes everywhere!n Hot water Just bought  Was doing the previous cleaning water run through. Cold side ran through fine. For the hot side I pushed and held the safety button and pushed the dispense button...nothing came out...help!!!n Awful....unless you just need a dispenser. - If this was an air compressor and water cooler I'd understand. This thing was SO LOUD it shook my bed in the upper level above my kitchen. Had to unplug it to talk at my kitchen table. Go get the Primo brand similar to this. You can't even hear it. So if you need a cooler for the shop or your airplane hanger this ones for you.n water dispenser LOVE THIS UNIT! It is great in a small place and hold a regular 5 gallon bottle nicely. The hot water is as it states HOT and cold is cold but not as cold as with ice cubes. The unit is stylish and appears well made. I like the stainless steel on black it fits most kitchen styles with modern appliances. As for a work area this would fit nicely in a small office.n Love This Unit This is a very nice addition to any area where hot and cold water are needed. I installed this in my shops warm bay. Since we use this area year round we can have hot water for lunchtime instant noodles or instant soups and tea to warm up in the wintertime. n The unit dispenses hot water in under a minute and has cold and room temp water on demand. The unit had some packing material inside the cabinet that made it noisy when cooling water, once that was removed it's much quieter. n We use a 5 gallon glass carboy for our water. Since we have very good filtered well water in the house we just keep cleaning and refilling the carboy. Makes water cost for us almost zero.n I can't say enough about having hot and cold water available all the time. Itu2019s also a great thing to have for company. I can see that this would be a great investment for most kitchens since the cost of 5 gallons of water is a fraction of the cost of other bottled water. This keeps tons of used water bottles out of the landfills too.nRead Less Good quality dispenser It has worked without any problems. I use the hot water dispenser for making tea and it is so fast and the right temperature. I do use the cold water daily. n The water comes out nice and cold.  Hot is hot cold is cold. Dispenses mush faster than getting water out of the fridge or heating water to make tea.n The dispenser is not loud and works perfectly. Additionally, We did notice a small serge in our electric bill but that was to be expected.n Sleek and stylish. Great look for home use. Dispenses very hot and ice cold water I havenu2019t had this dispenser for very long, but I really like it, and it looks nice in my finished basement, where my family and I watch TV, and I have a small office. Not having to run up and down the stairs to the kitchen for a glass of water is very convenient. This dispenser is sleek and stylish, with a clean look that arguably is more attractive than most dispensers that coordinate well with the décor of an office environment, but look out of sorts in the home. The dispenser requires no assembly, but should be thoroughly rinsed with a 50/50 solution of water and distilled vinegar to remove dust and any contaminates prior to use. The unit is well-constructed with a stainless steel exterior cabinet that does not show smudging and fingerprints. A 6-ft. electrical cord provides flexibility in terms of placement if an outlet isnu2019t conveniently located behind the dispenser. Hot, room and cold water is dispensed by tapping the appropriate button on the unit for the desired temperature of water. The hot button features a childproof safety lock that must be operated simultaneously with the button to dispense hot water. The fill area features a small blue lamp for dispensing in low light, and is approx. 8-inches high, which will accommodate large travel mugs. A small reservoir catches the drips. The dispenser uses 3 or 5-gallon water bottles (not included) that sit on top of the dispenser. This model does not feature a tap for hookup to a water line, but other model Vitapur dispensers do. The unit makes a little noise when first plugged in electrical outlet and periodically when the cooling element kicks in, but itu2019s barely audible and turns off after the cooler reaches the desired temperature. The dispenser lacks a storage cabinet in the base, but units that have the storage area arenu2019t usually refrigerated, so I donu2019t find them to be all that useful. The black plastic is glossy and easily shows dust and smudges. Ice cold water is dispensed from the cold side of the water dispenser while depressing the kettle button sends piping hot water to the hot side, eliminating the need to heat water in the microwave oven or on the stovetop for instant coffee, cocoa, tea or morning oatmeal. At about 30 lbs., the dispenser is lightweight. The base is narrow which can make it tip easily if accidentally bumped into, so it should be placed close to a wall or in a corner, or in an area with low traffic. There is a short, 3-second, delay for the hot water using the kettle feature, and the hot water tank is small, but is sufficient for several cups of hot water. Itu2019s difficult to dispense water with only one hand, but all things considered, this is a very nice water dispenser and is ideal for use at home or in a small office.nRead Less Does a fine job This is a pretty basic water cooler, which at this price point is about as much as you can expect. Even though there is nothing particularly fancy about this it does dispense cold water and that's what I wanted it for. The hot water is not an \"on demand\" type so when you want hot water it heats it up first then you can dispense it. This is about a 1 minute process, give or take a few seconds. This is not a big deal for me because I really only use it for the cold. Make sure you follow the directions and rinse it out with a vinegar/water solution to get any plastic taste out.n Great Perfect for me right out of the box.Easy set up after initial clean.Attractive design and keeps the water at the right temperature with very little noise.n Cooler leak at 4 months Only had the cooler for 4 months and the hot water spigot constantly drips. Calling Glacier Bay for warranty.n do not buy.... I'd hate ya to hear \"I told you so\"! This cooler is junk! You have to press the red button and wait a few minutes everytime you want hot water. When it heats up, it sounds like a jet taking off. Super noisey. I buy around 500k in building and remodeling products a year thru HD, this has to be the worst product I have ever wasted my money on. It is going back Monday morning. Hopefully you'll read these reviws before buying this. I had another cooler in mind when I went to buy this, HD showed they had 8 different coolers to choose from, in stock. They had 2. That was very dissapointing. I thought I was buying the better of the 2. I sure was wrong!!! If you buy this,,,, remember this phrase..\" I TOLD YOU SO!\" DO NOT BUY!!!!! Glacier Bay should stick to ceiling fans.nRead Less leaks! bad news Don't Buy This unit. I had to put a towel on the floor as it leaks from the bottom and on the top. The top where the bottle goes in needs a gasket as it leaks down the outside to the floor. plus you need to heat up the water first before you can use it. you can only get about two cups from the hot water at a time. The buttons are too stiff to work so you feel like they will break sooner or later. I returned it to the store so please don't buy this unit. I hope you read this...n Complete Garbage Actually lasted about a half a year before the compressor gave out and stopped cooling the water. Water splashes all over when replacing bottle, and top becomes dislodged. def not recommending to anyone ever.n Surprise surprise I bought this cooler alone with other products from Home Depot, to take with me to the Dominican Republic., where we just bought an apartment. It never worked. The compressor was dead on arrival. Don't waste your time and money in this product.n Not a good buy I am frustrated that the water cooler stops delivering water cold.n Love this dispenser The disign of the dispenser is slimmer then other dispensers. I have had 2 other dispensers and so far this one is better than the others.n Looks nice, and that's All Should have read some reviews before I bought it. The first thing I noticed was there really aren't instructions. Just pictures that don't necessarily make sense to anybody besides the author. Cleaned with vinegar and followed the setup pictures. Spilled water at top when placing jug. Pretty standard for these, so, okay. The water does not heat instantly. You have to wait for it. I can do that in a kettle or my microwave. The cold dispenser is slow. I mean sllllooooow. Plus - You can't fit a gallon jug at the spout, which is something I planned on doing all the time to make crystal light and other drinks. Fill your coffee carafe? No problem if you've got a couple of minutes and your back doesn't hurt from being stooped over. Needless to say - Going back to Home Depot tomorrow. On a secondary note to Home Depot. I'm pretty loyal to you guys, but some of the junk I've purchased from you lately is making me rethink that loyalty. Just saying.nRead Less Confusing instructions Just purchased and in the process of cleaning. In looking at the instructions #'s 11-14 allude to some nozzle that dispenses water in the rear. In inspecting the machine, I haven't been able to find this nozzle. If anyone has any insight that would be great.n Looks nice. Clean, fingerprint proof device. Looks great next to other stainless steel appliances.n only lasted 1 year and a month Water leaked out from the top after placing the jug and hearing a pop. Guy at home depot said this is common. Says there is nothing that can be done.n Looks attractive & works well (thus far) We've had this water dispenser for a couple of weeks and it's been performing well thus far.n Design:Well made, feels solid, looks attractive. The glossy black & stainless steel finish is modern and makes it look sleek. The stainless steel does not attract fingerprints which is excellent. It is a bit lower than I thought it would be. Our 20 month old can reach all the controls dispense cold water but of course she cannot dispense hot water as it comes with a safety lock feature.n Installation & Preparation:It comes fully assembled. Once removed from the box it is recommended to let it settle for a while before plugging in. It includes picture instructions for clean-up and preparation. You need to clean the unit before use. It requires special water dispenser cleaner OR using hot water & vinegar. I used water & vinegar and it took 15 min or so to complete the recommended cleaning. The water still tasted like vinegar after cleaning so you need to waste a couple more cups of fresh water than what they recommend.n Cold Water:You can adjust the temperature of dispensed cold water using a screwdriver. The dial is located at the back of the unit. When the water reaches the set temperature, a solid blue LED light turns ON in the front of the unit. Dispensing cold water is easy and the flow is strong. It is relatively noisy when cooling, even noisier than our side-by-side fridge. But luckily it takes only seconds to re-cool the water!n Hot Water:This unit offers hot water \"on demand\". It has a \"kettle\" features which means it will not heat the water unless needed. This will save tons of energy and is actually what gives it the Energy Star label. It takes 2-3 minutes to heat the water up, so press the button before you actually need it. It feels like a long time but if you go do something else in the meantime then time will pass quickly! The water comes out very hot and good enough for hot tea. It gets a bit noisy as the water heats up. To dispense hot water it has a safety lock feature that requires getting used to when using one hand.n So far we are happy with this unit. I hope it lasts long enough without leaks or failures!nRead Less So Far Its excellent I have been using this fridge for 2 months now and I love it. Cold water temp can be adjusted from the back but I'm using the factory set temp because its cold enough to not cause irritation to the mouth. Hot water is on demand and it takes 30 sec to heat up. I have not experienced any leaks or low pressure in the water. Push down buttons are sturdy and the hot side has a child lock. The fridge makes very low noise, we eat in the same room with no issues. Overall, I'm very happy with this choice and I recommend it in every household.n Good Water Dispenser This is a very good filtration water dispensing machine. I like to have the hot water ready to go for a cup of tea or instant oatmeal. The cold water comes out very cold. The instruction manual was mostly pictures with some text. Once I figured out what some of the pictures were trying to tell me, it was not hard to get this system up and running. It showed that you must wash your hands and keep whatever would be in contact with the top opening and the jug of water clean. It said to first use vinegar and water to clean the system through and then rinse with fresh water and dispense 2 cups each of the hot and cold spigots. The water though, still tasted of vinegar for awhile. I made some tea and served some cold water. Very good and convenient.nRead Less Works as it Should Only had mine for about a month now but it works as planned & needed....n Item was delivered well packaged (shipped) inside a plain cardboard box containing another box (the retail package) surrounded by foam. The dispenser was securely cradled within the retail packaging with no damage. Installation is simple & the cord was ample length for our needs. My only complaint/wish is that the head on the cord would have been much better as a 90° so it would lay flay against the wall, helping to prevent tripping or accidental breakage of the wall outlet.n I opted to purchase a 5-gallon bottle & it worked fine. Spilled some water, as expected. Had a little issue with the 'Low Water' light staying one after I installed the bottle but it did turn off a short time later; once all the air in the system worked its way out. For our needs, the cold water was the only needed option. It is colder than room temperature but not to the coldness of a household refrigerator. Maybe this is something I can adjust but haven't looked into this as of yet.n The overall look & fit/finish of the product is nice. It has a small blue LED glow so it is easy to see at night.n The rising price (18% increase in the last 6 months) of store bough bottle water [gallon size] here in CA led us to the need for a dispenser. We now pay less than 50 cents/gallon using our own 5-gallon bottle as compared to about $1.30/gallon shelf price and reduce our dependency on waste from plastic bottles. Made good financial sense for our needs.nRead Less attractive bottled water dispenser This is an attractive bottled water dispenser that delivers hot and cool water. It also features room temperature water but that is really just the hot button with the kettle button turned off. It came pre-assembled so the only set-up is the initial cleaning with a water and vinegar mixture and plugging it in. Once the initial cleaning was done all you have to do is put the bottle of water on top and youu2019re ready. The hot water gets very hot so the child guard is a good thing but itu2019s a little awkward when using. We initially had an issue getting water from the hot water u2013 found out that we hadnu2019t waited long enough for the initial heating. After about 30 minutes it worked. Now when the hot button is pressed, itu2019s ready in less than a minute. You have to have a special water bottle top. We were lucky that the one we got already had that kind of top. We really didnu2019t like the picture only instructions. Some were not clear. Since weu2019ve only had it a short time, I have no idea how long the features will last. For now, it does what it says it does and looks pretty cool. It appears well built. The design seems well thought out. The hot water heater only runs as you use it, so it should save energynRead Less Water, Water Although packed well. Looks good and easy to follow instructions I did find a glaring oversight. The ad and description states this is a hot,cold filtration water dispenser. Not as delivered. The filtration system is another product and purchase! For another 50 dollars or so that is a big misprint.The filter and proprietary bottle system is available. Uses standard commercial service bottles also.After following instructions about cleaning prior to use the unit has worked week for the week of ownership. The larger bottle/cup area is a plus for use with tumblers or taller containers. I experience no odd smells or taste changes. I advise to NEVER use tap water due to the mineral content that is know to kill water coolers.nRead Less Brand New Junk Just purchased unit, did not plug in, cleaned per instructions, tried to run water thru hot and cold spigots. Hot side would not dispense water at all. Cold side did dispense water. Tried Hot side several times, no water, drained via cold side. Read instructions again, decided to drain reservoirs from drain on back to try to clear air-lock. Refilled with water, Hot side still would not dispense water. Drained again, saw some small back fragments of plastic but not big enough to plug the lines. Refilled again and drained over and over, never got it to dispense water. I got a tire pump and pumped backpressure into the faucet side with the valve open and could hear it gurgling. Refilled, no water would dispense from Hot side. The box says do not return to store so I guess I will call HomeDepot tomorrow and see if I can return it because judging by other comments, servicing is not good! This unit is junk in my opinion, a brand new unit won't pass water out the Hot side, forget about it being hot, I never even got to plug it in! Don't buy this item, in fact steer clear of Glacier Bay, it's not even a real company, I can find NO information online, it must be a HomeDepot subsidy, and a bad one at that. This unit deserves 0 stars, 0 quality and 0 value in fact it should have a negative value because I'm out $150.nRead Less Good Home Water Cooler This water cooler is great for the house. The water temp is adjustable and works well. The hot water runs on a kettle system. It is not on demand and takes 3 minutes to heat up.The cooler does have a refrigeration component to it so it does make some noise but nothing to crazy.There is also a little blue light that is on all the time. It actually provides a nice nightlight in the kitchen for night time.n It is also energy star approved.n I think this is perfect for a family home or small office.n Functional And Good Looking The water cooler is functional and easy on the eyes. The operators instruction are awful because they are mostly just pictures. I had to clean the cooler before it was used but it didn't take long they suggest to use vinegar or a water cooler cleaner so have some on hand before you start the cooler. The cooler has a kettle function so you have to press a button to heat the water and it takes about three minutes but it saves on energy and if I had a coffee maker it would take longer than that so no big deal. I see a lot of reviews that have a concern with the spear in the top but you can buy a cap that slips on your bottles and it's reusable plus it can be bought just about anywhere on line or local stores. The cooler has a blue light that's on all the time and the hot water has a safety lock feature. There is also a cold water light that lets you know if the water is cold and a dial on the back to adjust it colder or warmer.nRead Less Handy Handy source of dispensed hot or cold drinking water. Initial setup was time consuming but once ready just add water bottle and your ready for use. Only heats water on demand takes about three min. Cold water is adjustable. Unit is noisy makes as much noise as my refrigerator when running and has this annoying blue led light that never goes off. But with these exceptions the unit meets my family needs for a source of usable water in a small footprint in my kitchen. It's not an out of the box use item. Read instructions which are difficult to understand and clean out dispenser before use. Water bottle must be purchased separately.n Not Worth It Piece of junk. looks like a nice unit at 1st, but don't judge a book by its cover. Stopped giving cold water from 5 months of purchase and when it doesn't work, they only warranty you for the small problem ( which rarely never occurs ) than the big problem ( compressor issue ). I was referred to a repair shop who claims that its a cheap unit HomeDepot purchased from China which they can never get access to the unit schematics to understand it better. So was insisted by the repairman that the repair cost was almost same price as a brand new unit so i should junk it. Thanks Homedepot!n Disappointed Purchased this dispenser 4/16/2014. Very disappointed. Water comes out slowly from spigot. When you place a new water bottle on it, it splashes all over. Even with the thermostat set higher, water was not that cold. Takes 20-30 seconds for the hot water to heat up. In May, 2015 quit working, it wouldn't get water cold. Called Home Depot customer support. The were great and connected me to Glacier Bay. They thought since warranty was just over by a month that they might replace it. Glacier Bay informed me to have a repair person to come and look at it. If it was the compressor they don't replace that and if it was a thermostat they would replace it. It was not worth it to pay a repair person to come look at it. Will NEVER buy Glacier Bay again!nRead Less Good Purchase so far Keeps the water cold and does not leak, does the jobn Glacier Bay Water Cooler Water Cooler works very well. Only drawback is you need to wait for water to heat up, maybe 20-30 seconds. Otherwise a very good product!!n Made poorly, leaked in 2 days Took home and followed the directions and it leaked in 2 daysn not verry good poor at best water bottle on top is shaky , my big problem was it leaked from the cold dispenser after 60 days , returned it for another brandn So Far So Good So far my experience with this cooler has been very good. The cold water temp can be adjusted with a small screwdriver via a control dial on the rear of the machine. At the max setting it's perhaps not quite as cold as a bottle of water from the fridge but close enough. The hot water is definitely suitable for brewing a cup of tea or for making instant coffee. However, because the machine is \"energy star\" rated you must push a button and wait a minute or two as the water heats. This is what they refer to as \"on demand\" hot water. Kind of a minor annoyance but It does save money since the water is only heated as needed. When the hot water is ready to dispense the button's light stops flashing and goes to solid red. There is virtually no set up other than running a quick cleaning cycle before first using the machine. As for aesthetics, the unit is nice looking assuming you're happy with modern stainless steel styling.n The main \"con\" with this dispenser is the tiny intake spout. If you use a screw-on cap & ball adapter (available for a few dollars at most water stores) or the special caps that are pierced in the center as the bottle is placed on the machine you'll be fine. That said, if you don't use an adapter you'll have a bit of a mess on your hands because the intake fills instantly as you tip the bottle causing water to splash and/or overflow until the bottle is seated.nRead Less Broken in Two Months I bought one of these from Home Depot. Looked nice. Has all sorts of warnings about how it must be left to stand in a vertical position for 24 hours before turning on. Who has room in a typical car to \"stand up\" a water cooler box? Perturbed already, I waited until the next day to set it up. It has bright lights. Why does every appliance come with lights? Just heat up and cool down the water. if there is need for an indicator, it needn't be equivalent to airport landing lights. But I digress. This thing heats up water only as you need it, so if you need hot water, say for a cup of tea, or instant coffee, or to heat up the baby's bottle, or whatever, you have to wait 45 seconds for the quick boiler to work. I learned to live with that aggravation after a while. Then it broke. No hot water ever again. Very disappointed in this product.nRead Less water splashes out I love the fact that the water gets very cold, like refrigerator cold, but severely dislike the fact that the reservoir is so small that when I replace the jug the reservoir fills up and as the jug is lowered it pushes water out and it splashes water all over the place. I had their cheaper version and this did not happen because the reservoir was much bigger. I gave it only two stars because of the tiny reservoir but other than that I do love the cooler.n Cold water function broke after 1 year Bought this product about 15 months ago. The water no longer dispenses cold. Very difficult to troubleshoot. Customer service was not helpful, they told me I didn't live near a repair center (I live in Houston, its a huge city). They suggested that I call a small appliance repair shop, that shop told me it cost $100 in labor to look at the appliance and I was better off just buying a new one.n very poorly designed product, will not accept standard water bottle I purchased this product last week and found it had something called a piercing valve which with a normal water bottle gets in the way of installing a new bottle. Tech support informed me that to use a standard bottle w/o a self-piercing membrane I should go to Amazon to purchase caps and membranes to turn the bottles into one which could be used in this poorly designed product. If you try to place an open bottle on the dispenser you end up with water on the walls,floor and dispenser because of a minimal amount of clearance for the bottle spout.n Great home water cooler! I purchased this water cooler in May because I didn't like the taste of my tap water and individual bottles of water were inconvenient. My dispenser delivers cold water quite fast and the amount of time it takes to chill the water is quick too. Now when the family comes over for a get together everyone drinks my water! The only drawback is the spike. I found replacement bottle caps on line that allow me to swap the bottle without spills but it would have been nice if there were a couple in the box! Overall, I'm very pleased with my dispenser and recommend it to all my friends!n Slow dispenser This cooler dispenses water so slowly I barely use it. It looks good and the water comes out cold, but literally it takes like a full minute to fill up a small glassn We had this cooler for 1 year and has developed a leak.

I bought my Glacier Bay water dispenser about 5 1/2 years ago and it worked just great for me during that time. However, like so many others, the dispenser stopped cooling the water. For me, this occurred at that 5 1/2 year mark. Being a guy who likes to repair stuff, I went through a process of You Tube water dispenser repair videos, etc, culminating in a call to the GHP Group, who supplies or makes Glacier Bay and Vitapur (same unit with different names) water dispensers and they told me that there are no parts available and no repair options. So I will have to throw it out and buy some other unit. My problems with this unit is the lack of a way to repair the unit and also an obvious lack of reliability - In the reviews, I see some units lasting a year, three years, and mine 5 1/2 years. I am going to try another brand.nRead Less Leaked day 1... Leaked day 1n The hot water dispenser function is difficult to work. It... The hot water dispenser function is difficult to work.

Better than the plastic one we had.n Perfect Filtered Water Dispenser It's shipped securely with the display box inside a protective outer box. I was expecting the unit to be heavier because of the on board cooling compressor but at only 43 lbs. It's light enough for anyone to move around and setup. The four feet are not adjustable so it's important that the unit be positioned on a flat and level surface. n Unpacking the accessories I found the \"drip tray\" which is really a drip reservoir. It's about an 1-1/2 in. deep with a red \"bobber\" which I assume is an indicator of when the reservoir needs to be emptied. The unit snaps into place easily on the front of the machine. The unit ships with 1 filter, 1 extra filter flushing adapter, 1 adapter with shut-off valve and 1 anti-tip bracket. The included filter is rated for 1500 gallons or six months. There's a red indicator light that will blink when its time to change the filter. Home Depot has the replacement filter, model \"Avalon Replacement Filter For Bottleless Water Coolers A4FILTER\" but I found them for less on a popular auction site. There's also a built-in \"Self-Cleaning / Sanitizing\" button that should be activated weekly. It takes 90 minutes to run through the cycle. n Installation is easy as long as you have a sink and a 15 amp grounded outlet nearby. The included adapter goes between the cold water supply line and the cold water line to the faucet. The 1/4 in. line to the unit pushes onto the \"T\" adapter and is secured by tightening the nut. I had an existing \"T\" fitting already installed from an ice machine I no longer needed so I used it. The filter needs to be flushed, for about 5 minutes, using the extra flushing adapter before it's twisted into place on the unit. Connect the hose to the filter, plug in the electrical cord and it's done. n It takes about an hour for the cold water to reach optimal temperature and about 15 minutes for the hot water (about 185 degrees). I found that the cold water is crisp enough that, for me, ice is not needed and the hot is perfect for tea or instant coffee. I like them very hot. n One Year Limited Warranty for Avalon Water Coolers.This warranty extends only to the original purchaser of the product and lasts for one (1) year from the date of original purchase or until the original purchaser of the product sells or transfers the product, whichever first occurs.

Pros: Looks Great, Nice Design Cons: Difficult to Cleann MUCH better than water delivery service I've been looking for options for filtered water and was thinking about the large cooler with water delivery service, but when this popped up for me to try out, I jumped at the opportunity. The idea makes so much sense! Not dealing with water delivery, having cold/hot filtered water right on my counter. I love that. A lot of people are saying that hookup is really easy, but for me I couldn't figure it out on my own so I had a guy come over to install it. It's a little taller than I thought but I have the perfect spot for it so it works out. The water flow is similar to that of the large coolers that are at the office and it dispenses clean tasting water. I had to flush it out before using because it has this plastic or chemical taste at first. So make sure you do that first. The hot water dispenses water similar to my Nespresso machine temperature. I use it for tea, oatmeal, soup etc. Really handy. So far I'm loving this option FAR more than dealing with water delivery. This just makes so much sense. Would be perfect for any type space.

One thing I really like is the ability to select if you want the hot water or cold water features on or off.

You may also need to be strategic about where you place this. Obviously you need power but the height of the unit also means a counter top may make it difficult to load new water jugs due to the height and strength needed to hoist one up.

The bottom portion of the cooler has stylish rounded corners. The cooler is packaged very nicely & surrounded with Styrofoam and wrapped in plastic. The instructions read very easy! There are three buttons on the top for hot, cold, and room temperature water. There is a safety lock for the hot water. I would strongly recommend to anyone looking for a more stylish water cooler / dispenser! A+n This is a great top load water dispenser. This is a very nice addition to any area where hot, c... This is a great top load water dispenser. This is a very nice addition to any area where hot, cold and room temperature water is needed. We use this in our shops warm bay. Since we use this area year round we can have hot water for lunchtime instant noodles or instant soups and tea to warm up in the wintertime. In summer we have both cool room temperature water and ice cold for a very refreshing drink on a hot day. n The unit dispenses about 3 cups of hot water in about two minutes for soups, teas or anything that needs near boiling water. The buttons for the hot, cool and cold water are nice and large making them easy to push and hold. The water dispensing area is large enough to hold almost any size of drink container. n We use a 5 gallon glass carboy for our water. Since we now have very good filtered well water in the house as well as the shop, we just keep cleaning and refilling the carboy. This makes water cost for us almost zero since glass is easy to clean. Loading the unit is very easy when using store bought water five gallon carboys. Just remove the tape covering the very center of the cap and slide the water jug over the coolers center pin. It's really very easy and there is no mess.n The water dispenser is very quiet when cooling and heating water. This is great if your kitchen is adjacent to your family room.n I can't say enough about having hot and cold water available all the time. Itu2019s also a great thing to have for company. I can see that this would be a great investment for most kitchens since the cost of 5 gallons of water is a fraction of the cost of other bottled water. This one cooler will keep many thousands of used water bottles out of landfills.nRead Less We have rented a dispenser from the water company for years. Although it is only a few dollars p... We have rented a dispenser from the water company for years. Although it is only a few dollars per month, it adds up, so I got this dispenser and now we only purchase the water bottles. I love that it has three options - hot, room temp, and cold. The hot is pretty hot and works fine right from the machine for my hot tea. The cold is icy cold. The bottles don't \"burp\" as loudly on this dispenser and so far there hasn't been a single drip or anything to clean up. There was no assembly required. There are cleaning instructions but I haven't had to do that yet. It sits in a corner out of the way and the top mounted buttons keep small kids from using it without help.n The finish on the unit looks great.

This unit does not have storage under the unit even though it states it does in description. One of the best features on this unit is that if you are not going to use all the time you can turn off the heating and cooling unit separately by using the two switches on the side. I know some people may be concerned about the amount of electricity used by the dispenser but once the water is heated and cooled it stops running so the electricity to run will be minimal. When the unit is running it is very quiet so no worries about that. I was curious just how many cups of hot water you could get at a time so I put it to the test. The first two cups come out very hot but by the third cup you could tell a difference. We use in a summer home and was surprised out just how quick you become accustom to having cold water and hot water at the touch of a button and you don't have the waste of all the individual water bottles and taking up space in your fridge. Highly recommend for the home or office.nRead Less The Avalon 3 temperature water cooler is a great addition to any home. I set mine up in the kitch... The Avalon 3 temperature water cooler is a great addition to any home. I set mine up in the kitchen and it was very simple to set up and surprisingly light weight. The best feature for me is the 3 temperatures ,especially the hot water dispenser as this makes baking and instant recipes a breeze. The cold water dispenser should help to cut down on the expense of individual bottled water. Its lean black and chrome design is modern enough to match any kitchen decor.n Great looking water cooler for a small office. The water cooler dispenses ice cold water, however... Great looking water cooler for a small office. The water cooler dispenses ice cold water, however the hot water dispenser isn't quite hot enough for more than your average cup of tea. It could go a little hotter, but there's no way to adjust the temperature on the cooler itself. The area under the spigot could be a little larger as it doesn't accommodate larger containers.n Beautifully designed water dispenser that has all the buttons on the top instead of typically on... Beautifully designed water dispenser that has all the buttons on the top instead of typically on the front. The 3 operational buttons are larger and easy to depress, the stream of water is forceful so there is less wait time, The hot button has a red switch that slides over to one side then you press down as usual. It gives room temperature water which is great when your preparing a microwave meal that requires adding water (like stuffing) but you dont want to use faucet water if your on a well system like many people are. On the sides there are handles to make moving it easier -most coolers do not have this feature & there are cold & hot water shut off switches to save energy if for instance you dont want to use the hot/cold water for awhile. This water cooler looks very cutting edge with its updated style & would look good in a business setting, i put it in my vacation home kitchen and its fine, i get compliments on it.nRead Less I got the Avalon top loading water cooler to replace a 12 year old unit we were using. It has thr... I got the Avalon top loading water cooler to replace a 12 year old unit we were using. It has three different dispensers for hot, room temperature, and cold. According to the specs, the hot is 180 degrees and the cold is 47 degrees. I didn't use a thermometer but the hot is hot enough to make tea and instant coffee. The lower storage area is a nice feature.n This sleek water cooler is small and easy for to put anywhere in your home or business. It has ho... This sleek water cooler is small and easy for to put anywhere in your home or business. It has hot, cold, or room temperature water options. The cooler can handle a three (3) or five (5) gallon bottle. The instructions are easy to read and understand. The water is hot enough to make instant coffee, hot tea, or any other item you wish to start off hot. The cold water is cold as if you took out of your refrigerator. I would recommend purchasing this water cooler over bottled water. It will save you money in the long run.n I purchased the Avalon Top Loading Water Cooler Dispenser in Stainless Steel to have the convenie... I purchased the Avalon Top Loading Water Cooler Dispenser in Stainless Steel to have the convenience of immediate access to different water temperatures all year round. The ease of use by simply selecting a spout to receive hot or cold water for whatever beverage you choose at the time is very handy. Since it is child safe even the kids can get their own cold water but adult supervision is required for the hot water unit. This is a great advantage to parents so that no child is hurt when selecting hot water to make tea or hot chocolate. The red (hot water) safety button is pushed to the side and then pressed down to activate the hot water spout while the other buttons are simply pressed down. This is a beautiful stainless steel dispenser that looks like a lovely appliance and fits very well into my kitchen décor. The cold water provides great cold water and the hot water provides a good 180 degree temperature. What I like is the storage cabinet capability that allows you to store another water bottle in the bottom. If you like having the convenience of having immediate access to hot or cold water any time of day or night, this unit is for you. It doesnu2019t get much better than that. Highly recommend this dispenser.nRead Less Nice design, compact, how water is hot enough to brew tea. Cold water is nice and chilly. Machine...

There are times it is great but depending on the water levels and time of the year it can have a problem with hydrogen sulfide. If you aren't sure, that is the stuff that smells like rotten eggs that goes into propane so you can smell a leak. Blech. I'm so not drinking that. We've been doing bottled water and more than a little bit of soda. I decided to kick the soda habit so started drinking more water. I feel really bad burning through so many bottles, even with recycling, plus the costs. I decided to get a water cooler. Going into it I knew I wanted instant hot water and a bottom loader. I did a good bit of research that led to this unit. Most the brands have as many 1 star as 5 star reviews, often worse. The big review articles all pointed to this brand (though a different model). I opted to step up a bit to get the self cleaning feature because I know I'm not going to take it apart to clean as often as I should and am not interested in drinking nasty water.nRead Less Looks nice.

Returned from lunch to find water on the floor. Noticed a small steady stream of water coming out of the internal cabinetry. Followed the instructions to remove the top bottle support cover and found a mangled gasket that was not sealing correctly. See photo. Put it back together and returned to HD to swap it out for another one. Five minutes after installing a different 5 gal water bottle on the new unit it also started to leak. Removed the bottle support collar and found the same gasket disfigured, just not as bad as the first one. Persistence sometimes pays off so hopefully third time is the charm as it is sleek and looks nice in my office.nRead Less 1 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern Dispenser is nice but the space under the faucets is so short we can't even get a mason jar or ou... Dispenser is nice but the space under the faucets is so short we can't even get a mason jar or our water bottles under it. Also the cooler is not good for using a water filtering unit on the top. When you take the baffle out that pierces a filled water bottle, it leaves a lot of open space where your nice clean water is to go.

Our office is not large and space is a premium, so to have this share the coffee maker was such a dream. Having hot and cool water at all times is such a bonus. Tea for those cold days, and nice cold water during those hot summer days. A great sturdy product that acts just like a floor stand, but smaller.n I was excited to receive the Avalon Premium Hot/Cold Top Loading Countertop Water Cooler Dispense... I was excited to receive the Avalon Premium Hot/Cold Top Loading Countertop Water Cooler Dispenser with Child Safety Lock, White. It is a large countertop unit, and seems well made except for the water paddles and child safety lock, which are rather flimsy plastic. I decided to buy a 3 gallon bottle to make loading easier and was able to load with only a small amount of spillage. I waited overnight to test the water temps and, using a thermometer, found that the hot water is 160 degrees, which is above the AZ health standards for food which is 140 degrees, but is lower than I expected. The cold spout delivers 45 degree water, while tap water locally is 80 degrees, so it is cold enough if drinking immediately, as you would at a water cooler at work, but warms quickly. Was it worth the expense? For situations where a fairly hot and cold drinking water are not available, yes. From a standpoint of reducing the amount of plastic water bottles in the landfill, yes. For me, no.nRead Less I got this because I had a smaller space available and didn't want the bulk of the floor model. ... I got this because I had a smaller space available and didn't want the bulk of the floor model. This unit is roughly 12\"W x 12\"L x 19\"H (without the bottle) so it's a good fit for the corner of my counter in the basement (no cabinets above it). In terms of functionality, it more or less does what it says - provides you cold or hot water quickly. The hot water isn't instantaneous, but it is quicker than a microwave (without the hot cup!) or a stove top tea kettle. Just a nice little luxury to have.n Love love love my water cooler hot water for my ...

What I like about this hot and cold water dispenser is that it sits on top of a counter and does not take up floor space. It does not need a stand like the floor models and is very compact but perfectly sized for our smaller space. We use a lot less small plastic water bottles which is a good thing for the environment. We can make a cup of hot tea, hot chocolate or instant soup by using the hot water dispenser-very convenient.

Me and my wife have talked about getting a water cooler for her craft shop because sometimes she needs water for her projects and sometimes for a drink of cold water and never thought how great it would be to have hot water also , so when we saw this counter top water cooler dispenser that also dispenses hot water , we decided to go for this model and liked it so much we also got one for our house also and they provide nice cold water and very hot water and even though we do not have any young children , the child safety lock is a plus.n I really like this water dispenser.

I keep it at work and it's very handy to have around.n One of the best features is how attractive it is. It just looks like quality and it's something I wouldn't mind having in my kitchen or somewhere else in the home.n I also like the ability to turn the heating or cooling functions off. The only issue is that it then takes a while to heat or cool. But that's OK. It gets water hot enough for a cup of noodles or tea/coffee and cool enough to be very refreshing on a hot day.n It's also handy that it works with 3 or 5 gallon bottles. The carry handles are a plus, too.n All in all this thing is a great value if you're looking for a hot/cold water dispenser. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this unit.nRead Less This water dispenser is very easy to use. The directions are good and it sets up and ready for us... This water dispenser is very easy to use.

There is a switch on the side of the unit so you can turn off or on the cold or hot water and save power. The unit has handles on the sides for easy carrying. It can be used with a 3 or 5 gallon water bottle but each gallon is 8.34 pounds. There is a water drain on the back of the unit.

Button sticks! Don't buy this product!! The button sticks & water just keeps going...you have to bang the cooler to get the button to pop back up to stop the water... makes such a mess!!!! horrible product! Doesn't even deserve the one star but had to select it... buyer beware!!!n Cook or Hot this Item has it. I bought this as a gift for my son and his family who had relocated to a new city and house. After the initial 24 hours waiting period this item functioned as good as any professional water cooler I have ever use. They loved it.n Great value for the price! We moved around a LOT - my husband is active duty Army - so we're hesitant to spend a lot of money on non-essentials that might not be able to move with us. We had to leave our $350 water cooler behind during our last move, so I wanted something under $100 that was still reliable for every-day use.n I found this in store, and figured it was worth a shot. It came with one free bottle, and I believe I received a discount on any additional bottles I bought at the same time, plus a military discount on top of that (thanks, Home Depot!). It's smaller/shorter than more expensive coolers, but this proved to be a plus - it fits neatly in the corner of our kitchen, and it's short enough for my four-year-old to reach without assistance. We keep a small plastic tumbler on the drip tray so he can get himself water - our previous cooler was too tall and he needed our help to reach, but now he's able to reach whenever he wants. I also appreciate the push-button for the hot water (which most coolers seems to have now), which is tricky enough to stop him from accidentally accessing it, but easy for adults to use when needed. By the way, the hot water temperature is perfect for tea or instant coffee!n The cold water button does stick occasionally (a problem I've experienced with every single water cooler I've ever owned) but it's the result of sugary or sticky substances getting inside the mechanism - from making and dripping sugary drinks onto the button, from sticky hands, and occasionally from getting too humid during the summer. To fix this, I use a wet rag or sponge to squeeze clean water over the button, then use a q-tip to clean in between the crevices. I keep an empty mixing bowl underneath the spigot to catch the water so it's not wasted (and doesn't spill all over the floor). I also clean the spigots with clean water (no cleaning solution - this can contaminate the water) and a q-tip every few months, which is something you should do for any water cooler.n We've had this for nearly two years now, and I'm pleasantly surprised at how well it's held up to daily heavy use. I've recommended it numerous times, and two of our neighbors now own it and love it. We're due to move soon and I'd be surprised if it came with us, so if it doesn't, I'll definitely be buying another one as soon as we move in!nRead Less Junk dont waste money Buttons leak junk I have 2 no good ones and home depot wont refund me or credit my accountn Solid Product Just purchased this cooler - out of the box intact and doing what a cooler should - serving chilled water reliably.

Historically, I have used only bottled water coolers in the home. A few weeks ago, I moved into a large, single-family home where we were using a Brita filter to have drinking water. Since refilling five gallon water bottles is just not financially viable for us, I decided to splurge on this countertop bottleless water cooler and I couldn't be happier. I had my plumber come and install it at the little mini bar at our home and it was up and running in less than an hour.n This Avalon countertop water dispenser has more features than others on the market. It dispenses ... This Avalon countertop water dispenser has more features than others on the market. It dispenses cold water at forty seven degrees and hot water at one hundred and sixty eight degrees. Cold enough to drink without adding ice and hot enough to make coffee, tea, instant soup etc. The best part is that no more lugging heavy water bottles from the store and then having to return the empties.There is not even a refilling tank on the top.n What this has is a self cleaning system and a water filter. The self cleaning feature has instructions in the booklet about how to clean every three months. The water filter ( one filter included ) improves taste, removes odors, chlorine, lead, and cysts. It is recommended to change filter approximately every six months or 1500 gallons. I go by the taste test. When it starts having any taste, that's when I change it.n The water is connected directly to the under counter water line, so refilling is not necessary.There is a nightlight and safety switch on the hot water dispenser. The paddles are just like the ones on refrigerators. This unit also comes in white. It is energy star approved.nRead Less Have this installed in our new office.

First off it is beautiful! It as compact as possible for what it performs and even though it claims some counter space it doesn't take up nearly as much space as full size water cooler. Second it is BOTTLELESS that means no running out to pick up water and all the hassle entailed. If you are concerned about the water quality I purchased the basic water purification system. Our city water is almost undrinkable from the bad taste and chlorine odor. This system delivers pure and amazing water. My kids are drinking a lot more water now. For me the third and best feature is the hot water function. For us this was a big purchase and one of the ways I rationalized this purchase was we needed a new coffee maker. We had a pod system but because of our poor water quality it only lasted a year (this is typical for coffee makers in our house) Dreading going back to the stove top which takes too long we purchased this water dispenser. I can't begin to describe the amazing feeling of just running water into your french press and having coffee in seconds. Now this leads me to really the best reason of all to buy this product. I had previously and hastily reviewed this product at only 2 stars. If i'm honest that wasn't fair but despite all of the great features of this product I was disappointed with the hot water. A cup of tea or coffee just wasn't quite hot enough and I'll say again I was disappointed.nRead Less hot water takes too long and quantity is not sufficient and noisy, hot water takes too long and quantity is not sufficient and noisy,n COOLER IS EASY TO LOAD, NO MORE SPILLING WATER FROM THE TOP LOADER KIND.

It looks like it was designed to be hinged, but it is just stuck on the base with some magnets. The magnets are not very strong and it doesn't take much of a bump to knock off the door.

I've had a Kentwood water dispenser for a while that I gave it up for this unit when I saw it at Home Depot. Especially when I saw that it also dispenses room temperature water - the Kentwood dispenser does not dispense room temperature water, but does dispense very HOT water. This unit does the job in dispensing the cold and room temperature water but the hot water takes a couple of minutes to heat up, apparently to save power - I'm not too thrilled about this. I'm not sure if there is a setting to keep the water hot all the time but apparently it shuts off to save energy. Also, there is usually plenty of water left in the bottle that doesn't dispense so I have to pull the bottle out and empty the remainder of the water and put in a new bottle. Again, not sure if there is a setting or some kind of adjustment for this. The instructions that came with this unit does not give you any insight on either of these minor inconveniences. For this reason I gave it 3 stars. If it turns out I can get INSTANT HOT WATER without waiting, and don't have to change the water bottle when there is plenty of water left in the bottle, I would have given it at least 4 stars.nRead Less Love this bottom feed water cooler.

FYI- I am experiencing problems with the water dispensing buttons. The cold button became stuck and one of the plastic \"nubs\" on the shaft that guides it broke off. It needs to be replaced. My unit is out of warranty. I called Home Depot customer service to order a new button. Home Depot called the company that manufactures the unit and then informed me that THERE ARE NO REPLACEMENT PARTS of any kind for the unit. Of course, had it still be under warranty, it would have been replaced. Since it wasn't, the only solution is to trash it and buy another one. I find it hard to believe that a water dispenser costing over $200 became trash in a little over a year and that Home Depot knowingly sells a product that can't be repaired, only replaced. Note: The water cooler that the Glacier Bay replaced was 25+ years old and still going strong.

We use to have a drinking fountain that wasn't used. People would come to the pool with their own isolated containers and no way to refill them while at the pool. The Avaion Water Cooler is the answer. We have received a number of positive responses for this in place of the drinking fountain. The unit looks nice and is holding up well. The only complaint is the cost of the replacement filters. So far this hasn't been a big deal. All in all this is a well made unit and is working well for our community's needs. Well worth 4 stars.n Bottleless Water Cooler This answered my dreams! We used to live on well water and always had bottled water delivered, so got used to having hot and ice cold water always available.

First of all, the unit is very stylish and has a clean look compared to water dispensers that have the huge bottle of water on top. This unit is bottleless and requires a small water line ran to wherever it is going to be used. Installation is extremely easy and should be easily done by the average homeowner. The area where the water is dispensed is very spacious and accommodates larger or taller containers. There is a child safety lock which is great for preventing burns on little hands!! This dispenser is ideal for families looking for pure tasting filtered water without the continual expense of buying bottled water. I would definitely recommend!! The item is very economical, doesn't take up much space, and is very easy to install!

This Self Cleaning Bottleless Water Cooler Hot Water Dispenser is an excellent addition to my kitchen. It has a relatively small footprint, and sits nicely next to my refrigerator.

I requested this bottleless water cooler dispenser with filter through the Home Depot Seeds reviewer program so that my wife wouldn't constantly ask me to bring her a bottle of water from the kitchen fridge up the countless stairs to the bedroom every single day. When this item was delivered I was immediately concerned by the very large puncture in the shipping box. Fortunately despite the unknown object punching through both cardboard boxes, the only damage to the product was extremely light scuffing at the impact point. not even so much as a dent in the metal construction.n I let the unit sit for 24 hours to let the compressor condensate settle and then connected the water line and powered up the unit. I waited for the compressor to cool down the temperature of the refrigerant and then tested the water.n I have to say the water was amazingly pure and quite refreshing for filtered tap water and the cooler definitely chilled the water.

Avalon \"Bottleless\" water dispenser is super! We chose this model because we have an Avalon bottom feed dispenser in our kitchen, and love it. This model attaches to your main water supply just like an ice maker on a fridge would attach. All required hoses and fittings are included. We attached ours under the sink in our basement in-law apartment. A replaceable carbon activated filter in used to filter tap water. Recommended to change approx. every 6 months. The hot water has a child safety lock and both hot and cold taps have a convenient push-paddle to dispense water. Hot water comes out hot enough for tea, coffee, hot chocolate and more. Cold comes out cold enough that you don't need ice cubes. Water dispenses much faster than our refrigerator and that's why we got this model. It also features a self-cleaning mode. A convenient night light is included. It is energy star rated. A side note to the manufacturer; there are a few text errors on the fine print on the carton. \"Innovation\" is spelled incorrectly, \"Innvaton.\" \"There is a built-in night....\" the word \"light\" is missing. It incorrectly states that this model is a bottom loading. We noticed these same errors on the carton of the first model. Perhaps the maker doesn't have proof readers, so I'm helping them out! See pics below.nRead Less What I really like about this water dispenser is that I donu2019t have to drill a hole into my granit... What I really like about this water dispenser is that I donu2019t have to drill a hole into my granite countertop, the is no need of a drinking faucet. Moreover, since it a standalone, it will not take up space in my counter. The design and size is perfect for office and home use. The installation of this machine was very easy, only requiring a small wrench and thread sealant tape. There is no pipe cutting, unless you want the water inlet shortened. After completing the installation, I opened all the valves and found no leaks. Great design and easy instruction!Furthermore, the water from the dispenser tasted a lot better than the water from the faucet. The temperature of the cold water is very refreshing. My family enjoys drinking teas and the hot water dispenser works perfectly for that purpose. In conclusion, the dispenser is attractive and with all the features it will be used frequently.nRead Less This is probably one of the best ideas ever!

I canu2019t even begin to say how many gallons of water I spilled on the floor! I finally gave the unit away! n This unit is an absolutely incredible design! I can give my family, including my loved doggies, a cold refreshing drink without the mess from bottled water. I can also use the hot water to make myself a nice cup of tea. It is plenty hot for the tea. I am drinking my tea and honey as I write this review. No doubt this unit will receive a lot of use! n Installation is fairly simple. I easily used the shut off under the sink. Before you even think about the installation read the instructions and be sure of your clearances for the unit. I also flushed out the water line as per the instructions. I have found anytime you disturb a water line you will have sediment break free and it can cause many issues. Luckily I also had power close by and easily accessible. I think it is an excellent idea to use the optional anti tip bracket! We are building a new house and I have noted to have the plumber and electrician install dedicated lines for this unit. n If your like me you will occasionally enjoy a drink of water during the night. The night light makes this possible without needing to turn on the house light! The self cleaning feature is a huge plus! n It also has a safety lockout on the hot water side to prevent young children from accidental injury. We donu2019t have any children but the our big dogs are already trying to figure out how they can get their own water. Laugh but I am very serious! Our German Shepherd is incredibly smart and I can see him using his nose to poke the water on. n Bottom line is this unit is an incredibly useful appliance! I have found zero negatives and it earns a five star rating!

You know that a product is good when it fades into the background of your environment and just works. This cooler silently works away to give you piping hot water on demand as well as some of the coldest water I've had. The minimal footprint makes it a great addition to a small space while still giving you all the convenience of a larger machine. The safety switch on the hot water prevents little hands from getting scalded if used in a home or daycare.

The cooler can provide cold or hot water with ample pressure, which is delivered in a steady stream. There are three indication lights located above the hot and cold water dispensers. The first is yellow, which indicates that the power Is turned on. The middle light turns red when it is heating the hot water. Finally, the third turns blue when it is cooling the water. n On the back of the water cooler, along the top left side, you will see two switches (refer to the third picture).One switch turns the power on to the unit and the second switch controls whether or not you would like to turn on the hot water feature. n You don't have to worry about your children getting scolded with hot water. In order to use the hot water you have to push down a red tab, which is located on top of the hot water dispenser. This is a great safety feature.n The only negative about this unit is that it can tend to get a little noisy when it is heating or cooling the water. It isn't excessively loud however you can definitely hear the compressor cycle on and off which provides a low humming noise in the background.nRead Less What a great counter top unit!

I am very mechanically inclined, but when I first opened the Electric Counter-top Water Cooler/Heater box, I was a bit apprehensive about doing the installation myself! I read over the instructions, looked at the pictures and reviewed all the parts that came with the item many times before starting. I thought I would need to purchase a special fitting to make the water connection to my water supply, but realized that the manufacturer had addressed all my needs. The small water shut-off valve provided has a feature where the 1/4\" poly ethylene tubing attaches. In order to make that \"slip on\" attachment, I first ran the hot water over the end of the tubing to soften it a bit before pressing it onto the valve. I then attached the new valve to the existing cold shut-off valve and reconnected the flex tube going to the faucet. I then drilled holes in the adjoining cabinet to run the tubing. I drilled a hole in the counter top to bring the line up to the location I had selected for the hot/cold water dispenser. In retrospect, I should have starting fishing the 1/4\" PE tubing from the counter top and then work my way toward the new valve THEN connected the tubing to the sink supply. Make sure before connecting the new water supply to the unit to flush the filters as directed to purge any loose filter media left over from the manufacturing process. With the \"ELECTRIC COUNTERTOP BOTTLELESS WATER COOLER WATER DISPENSER - 3 TEMPERATURE, UV CLEANING, 3 DISPENSING VOLUMES\" completely installed, we are enjoying both cool and hot \"instant\" water for our drinking. A FOOT NOTE: when locating the counter top 1/4\" water line hole, be very careful to account for the fact that cabinetry has a wooden support board running horizontally against the top back of the cabinet which provides counter support and strength to the cabinet. They are likely to be 3/4\" thick. Allow for this wood when drilling the hole. If you don't, you will be drilling through the wood and possibly creating more work.

I had installed this water dispenser about a week ago and took my time to really feel it out as it is currently meant to replace my Primo hot/cold bottled water dispenser. The look and feel of this unit is top notch. The buttons appear to be capacative touch where no pressure is required for it to determine which button you're pressing. I used a measuring cup to see how accurate the unit is as far as dispensing the appropriate amount of water and verified the large equals 10oz, med equals 8oz, and small equals 6oz. Hot water comes out at a piping hot 151F, while cold water was measured at 53F. While 53 is much colder than room temperature, I wish it could be colder (my Primo chills the water down to 48F). As far as The taste of the water- I tried my own makeshift taste test with my family and it seems that nobody could tell the difference between the Alhambra bottled water vs the Avalon filtered water. The filter units are rated to last 1500 gallons before replacement. That will basically replace 300 5 gallon Alhambra water jugs. If you're paying for a bottled water delivery service, this until will more than pay for itself in a short amount of time. Overall, I'm very happy with this unit and have actually cancelled my Alhambra water subscription.nRead Less I love the appearance of this water cooler/heater.

The idea makes so much sense! Not dealing with water delivery, having cold/hot filtered water right on my counter. I love that. A lot of people are saying that hookup is really easy, but for me I couldn't figure it out on my own so I had a guy come over to install it. It's a little taller than I thought but I have the perfect spot for it so it works out. The water flow is similar to that of the large coolers that are at the office and it dispenses clean tasting water. I had to flush it out before using because it has this plastic or chemical taste at first. So make sure you do that first. The hot water dispenses water similar to my Nespresso machine temperature. I use it for tea, oatmeal, soup etc. Really handy. So far I'm loving this option FAR more than dealing with water delivery. This just makes so much sense. Would be perfect for any type space.

Classy looking and providing filtered temperatured water. Assembly was very simply and installation was quick and easy to follow. All parts and hose were provided . The 3/8 line and fitting were snug and with no leaks. Filter information was provided along with where to get replacement. The temperature setting are very accurate too. Pros: Convenient, Easy to Clean, Easy to Use, Light Weight, Looks Great, Portablen We just purchased this electric counter-top water dispenser We just purchased this electric counter-top water dispenser to replace our fridge water dispenser. I love the fact that it has 3 temperatures, and the area to place bottles underneath is large and can accommodate most bottles. Living in Phoenix, we need to drink water all the time, so we really use this alot. So far, it has held up well and works great! Pros: Looks Great, Nice Design Cons: Difficult to Cleann MUCH better than water delivery service I've been looking for options for filtered water and was thinking about the large cooler with water delivery service, but when this popped up for me to try out, I jumped at the opportunity. The idea makes so much sense! Not dealing with water delivery, having cold/hot filtered water right on my counter. I love that. A lot of people are saying that hookup is really easy, but for me I couldn't figure it out on my own so I had a guy come over to install it. It's a little taller than I thought but I have the perfect spot for it so it works out. The water flow is similar to that of the large coolers that are at the office and it dispenses clean tasting water. I had to flush it out before using because it has this plastic or chemical taste at first. So make sure you do that first. The hot water dispenses water similar to my Nespresso machine temperature. I use it for tea, oatmeal, soup etc. Really handy. So far I'm loving this option FAR more than dealing with water delivery. This just makes so much sense. Would be perfect for any type space.

I was in need of a new water cooler for my upstairs kitchen. I choose this one as it has an interesting shape. I also like the stainless steel and black look. It fits in with my kitchen decor. After hooking this water cooler up I tested the hot and water dispensers. I found that the hot water works great and is at a perfect temperaature for me. I also found that the cold water is very cold and that works for me. Everything does work as it says.n Superb for hot water, chilled water, and filling personal water bottles!

I like the stainless-steel faceplate on this with a black body - it works in almost any kitchen decor. I tested the hot water: it dispenses at an impressive 185 degrees F. The cold side, about 2 hours after being plugged in and charged with a 5 gallon water bottle, was 45 degrees F. I do notice that the refrigeration unit has u201chumu201d in my otherwise quiet kitchen. The manual says if it is loud, the unit needs to be u201cmounted on a placid firm surfaceu201d - I had to look that up. It means tranquil, peaceful. They want you to mount it on a stable surface that does not itself have a rattle, such as a 4-legged table with one leg slightly shorter. It comes with a mounting bracket to help secure it to wood, which is also a safety feature, to ensure a child doesnu2019t pull the cooler over on herself. Thereu2019s an interlock on the hot-water dispenser as well, since it is a scalding output.If the hum is bothersome, this unit has two switches on the side: one controls the hot water heater, the other controls the chiller. I can simply turn off the chiller, water still dispenses, and the hum is gone, while I still enjoy the hot water. A note on dimensions: when fitted with a 5-gallon water bottle, this unit stands 35.75 inches tall. Without the water bottle, itu2019s actually 20.5 inches tall including the water bottle seating ring. The product spec says 19 inches tall. Overall, an attractive highly functional unit. Friends like it, and I recommend it.nRead Less I got this water dispenser thinking we would use it in the kitchen as a supplement to our reverse... I got this water dispenser thinking we would use it in the kitchen as a supplement to our reverse osmosis system (which is slow to fill larger water needs). We are on well water and I thought it would be healthier to use bottled water. Once unpackaged I realized the unit took up too much counter space for our use. Given that we already use a Keurig coffee maker (that can make hot water instantly) I moved the Avalon water unit to the basement workshop; and am happy with it in that location. This water dispenser would be ideal for an office setting/lunch room area but I can not recommend it for a kitchen (especially smaller kitchen with limited counter space.) I do like the function buttons: large and easy to read. Heats and cools water as advertised. The dispenser has a modern look and will fit in most kitchen decors (even more so in an office setting). The manufacturer recommends a thorough cleaning every three months, and while this makes sense some users may find this to be a hassle. I should mention that the unit will accommodate 3 and 5 gallon bottles ...a plus for me as I like the smaller bottle (easier to lift and insert into the bottle receptacle. I would recommend the Avalon for any office/work area.nRead Less This is a very nice stylish hot and cold model with a room temp button as well. It does have a re... This is a very nice stylish hot and cold model with a room temp button as well. It does have a refrigerator hum from the compressor and both the hot and cold can be independently turned on or off with separate power switches. Being on a counter, there is a higher lift when replacing the water jug. And having it as high as my head is not practical on my kitchen counter, so I will need to find a lower table to put it on. Heats and chills relatively quickly. The hot is near boiling for quick tea, coffee or soups. The cold was nicely chilled, but not as cold as water from my refrigerator. There are no settings for adjustment of the temperatures. Very nice, but some room for improvement. I would only recommend this model if you don't have room for a floor standing unit where you can put the water in the bottom of the unit. Changing jugs will be a challenge depending on the height of your countertop. The water jug is not included. There are also two carry hands on each side to make moving safer. If you don't mind putting a screw into your countertop, there is also a bracket to attach the unit to the counter to avoid tipping. I had a granite counter, so that was not an option, and the feet on the bottom were sturdy and I did not have any issues with stability.nRead Less Superb!

Hot water is steaming hot, cold water is nice and chilly. Be advised, the hot and cold lights on the front turn on and off by themselves, depending on whether the heating or cooling units are actively heating or cooling or not because the water is already at the desired temperature. UPDATE: You wouldn't think it, but having hot water on hand at all times has dramatically decreased my coffee consumption in favor of drinking more tea. So, added benefit.n Bang for your dollar I see a lot of bad reviews for this product. It's a shame because it is a good machine for home use. A little noisy when it filters through the refrigeration coils but not unbearable. The cold setting is easily accessible and once you find the right setting it stays constant. The blue display lights are seriously cool. If you want a Porshce on a Honda budget then the buyer should save their money until they can afford a $500 + unit. Trust me, not necessary. We are 5 in our family and we go through water as if it was........water.n Looks great This water dispenser is a great addition to my office suite. It is very sleek and stylish. Holds three, four or five gallon jugs of water. It is very easy to adjust for any of the three sizes. Since it is a bottom load dispenser it means you don't have to worry about lifting the water up over the dispenser. Simply put the line in the water jug and slide the just into place. Then just close the door. This dispenser does hot, cold or room temperature water.n Good value for the price Good size and weight bottom load dispenser. Bottom load design is really convenient to use. Easy to setup and has good functional design. Good stainless steel look makes a great finish and modern look. Good even flow of water from both hot and cold pipes. Energy efficient and quite useful for home. I could easily fit it in near kitchen and eating area. Overall good value for the price.n Great water Installation on this item couldn't have been easier. It has been in use since 10 minutes after it was delivered to our door. The water that comes out is the perfect temperature for drinking, hot or cold. The water jug is on the bottom, so for a residence the look is perfect. In the front area where you dispense your water the ledge is far enough down that you can select almost any cup or jug to fill and it will sit there. We use the 5G tanks of water and it is very easy with it being a bottom loader instead of having to lift the jug on top of a machine.n Really Disappointed PROS: This is a beautiful machine! Love the way it looks and the front lighting. The metal \"straw\" and top is a fantastic idea, however, see below for my take on the topper.n CONS:To be fair - Glacier Bay JUST took over the company that created this monster. I have called Glacier Bay to express my dismay at the heating option as well as the cold water option, if you have a water dispenser that has (or supposed to have, HOT - COOL - COLD why do you have to turn it around, find the hole in the back and turn the dial with a screwdriver to MAX cold?!?! If you want HOT water, you have to press a button, wait for the heater to kick in, the red flashing light turns to a solid red when ready but the first batch of water each time you try it isn't hot, because it is already in the holding area, it is the next batch of water that will be hot UNLESS the light goes off or you wait to long to dispense it. SO FRUSTRATING!n The dispensing bay back is flat, so if you are trying to fill your coffee pot or pitcher, it will be a wet mess.n The metal top that goes over the 5 gallon water bottle does not secure. Plus, I absolutely hated the magnetic front door! I don't want to have to take it off and place the magnets to the side of the cooler, hook up the metal straw to the hook on that door whilst changing out the water bottles! WHY?!?!?! This is so not necessary. A simple hinged door that swings open is such a better design. The door fell off twice while I was trying to secure the metal straw on it. FAIL! It hit the floor and had to be cleaned. The machine will not operate unless the door is on which didn't help be trying to fill anything other than a glass.n Returning this within the week to Home Depot. Will wait to re-order this when Glacier BAy has had a full re-do on this model.nRead Less Great look, easy to load, and efficient too! This Water dispenser is pleasant looking as well as functional. Room temperature, Cold, or hot water for making coffee, hot chocolate and soups. The water bottle can be variable up to five gallon container. And it slides easily inside the bottom section. The adjustment of the 3 different water bottle sized is extremely easy to change. Much easier than the inverted water cooler I currently have which is sometimes messy and when lifting and inserting the 5 gallon jug you get pinched and spill water down the side of the unit. The bottom load water dispenser eliminates those problems. I also like the stainless steel finish which goes nicely with any decor or room. This one went in the dining room next to the table where it will be used daily without a doubt. Great product and energy efficient.When I first plugged this unit in I left it at the original setting for cold/coldest setting and found that it was extremely cold and ran nearly constant. I adjusted it after calling Home Depot and they were extremly helpful stating what to do and what I was experiencing with the unit is not problematic. After the adjustment it works and cools plenty. The heated water also excellent it takes about 3 minutes to heat up the water and it is ready to dispense. And room temperature water can also be dispensed for cooking or whatever your needs are. Great product that will be used daily at my house. Thank you Home Depot.Example: the drill was really easy to assemble, lightweight and not noisy. I am really pleased with the battery life and was able to use the drill without charging for over an hour of heavy duty use...nRead Less Almost excellent I replaced an energy hog, name brand, member club special, hot/cold dispenser with this Glacier Bay. I'm not running the hot feature; when the compressor kicks on there is a noticeable energy dump (my circuits are stretched to the limit, so electrical fluctuations are pretty apparent,) so I'll see what the energy bill says -- the Glacier Bay is Energy Star qualified, my old one wasn't.n I wasn't impressed with the positive reviews of the silly features this has, until I used them: the ~1\" ramp is a huge help getting the bottle in; the telescoping stainless straw seems a lot more sanitary over time than plastic straws; I had no problem getting 5 gal and 3 gal bottles in it, and the front panel push button controls is a lot easier than fumbling for toggle switches in the back. This is also metal on the sides and back, and the four point magnetic removable door allows you to sandwich this between anything and a wall.n Negative reviews have complained of pump noise; I may have lucked out but mine sounds like a full refrigerator's compressor kicking on.n My only complaint is the control panel itself: \"Glacier Bay\" is illuminated from behind with a blue light, which doesn't bother me in itself, but there is a lot of bleed into the four LED indicators -- you just have to get used to what the blue bleedthrough and a discrete blue LED indication look like. The buttons are membrane, they won't be used much, but membrane will eventually finger rot. If Breville made this, it would have stainless buttons set in illumination, about 40 of them, and a LCD animated display of how many h2o molecules you have left. And it would have been about 40 times the cost, so I can live with a stupid membrane panel for room temp+ to ice cold water in just minutes.n I don't think anyone gives you a bottle, but I have to believe the margins on them are pretty thick at twenty plus shipping. Twenty plus shipping with no water.nRead Less Recommended! Easy set-up - has three water temperatures - very quiet compared to our previous top-load water dispenser. The hot is very hot, but does have to be turned on a few minutes prior to use. Great for hot tea! Easy to load bottles - very nice looking in our office!n Makes my life easier. I have to say that I really do like this water dispenser. we have one at work that you load from the top, so when I seen this was a load from the bottom, I was happy that I did not have to lift a 40lb water jug over my head every time I needed to replace it. It has a very modern, sleek look that blends in very nice with my stainless appliances. The dispenser is simple to operate. for cold water, just depress the top square button on the right with the blue snowflake. For hot water, press the round red steam button on the face to heat the water, then when ready (after about 2 minutes) push in the child proof tab and depress the to left square button with the red cup on it. The water gets very hot, so it's nice that the added the child proof feature on this. It also has a button for water to come out at room temperature, so you actually have three options for your desired water temp. As far as noise, it's a bit loud when the reservoir is filling up, but that only takes a minute. When its just sitting, is sorta sounds like Rice Krispies sitting in milk, but you have to be close to it to hear it. As far as water consumption, it takes every last drop out of my five gallon jug, and I just go to HD to replace it with a new one when empty. It will cost you about $14.00 for a new full jug, but Once you buy the jug for the first time, you can take it back to HD for a new full one for around $6.00. Its like a propane tank deal where you have to buy the cylinder first, but then just switch it out for cheap when you need a new one. All in all, I really do like this water dispenser. Makes life so much easier when making a warm baby bottle, or tea and hot chocolate for the wife and kids. You will not be disappointed with this buy!nRead Less So far we are very happy with it.... We have only had this a short time, but so far we are very happy with it. The hidden, bottom load bottles are great, easier on the back and no ugly blue water bottle exposed. It is much quieter than our old one that died (well, the cooler part died, not the hot). The hot button takes a little getting used to, but for safety reasons, it is fine. I'm sure my kids would never be able to make the hot water button work. The only thing unknown about this machine is how long it will last. Hopefully it will be a long time, because even my wife is very happy with it. Happy wife happy life lol. Updates will follow......n Great purchase. The water cooler was very simple to install and put to work.n LOOKS NICE BUT POOR QUALITY The product is good only to a year after I bought it, actually after 6 months of using it, it produced annoying sound just like an air conditioning unit. It is so annoying especially when I wake up in the morning. I tried to call Home Depot about the trouble but I didn't get any response to resolve the issue, u thought the product is a good quality despite that it is expensive but I feel sorry for myself it's NOT.n absolutely horrible!!! I was so excited to have a new water dispenser but extremely disappointed that it is so loud (not due to uneven floors) it does sound like an air compressor on all the time. Unplugged it, emptied it and currently boxing it back up to return. I will use my old one until I can find another.n Nice water cooler, with small hitch This is a great water cooler, but it does have some very minor flaws.n first off, the lights are insanly bright for this unit, and there is no way to them off. this isn't a major issue, but i do have this in my bedroom (as I live in studio-style apartment) and the light took some getting used to/n The design is fantastic! The bottom loading system is great, and doesn't leave you with any spills, and it is easy to set up and install into the bottom of the system. The front face is easy to place back after a water jug has been installed.The system can also take 3,4, or 5 gallon bottles, so it makes it a bit more veristly.n One other complaint (riding on the coatstrings of the design topic) is the top itself. The whole unit is sturdy, and you would (and can!) easily use the top as storage. I personally had left a glass there for late night water needs. Key word being \"had left\". The system tend to rattle after it finishes with a cooling cycle. It makes very little noise itself, but if anything is on top of the system, it can get really noisey.n And, on the topic of noise: this *can* be a noisey unit. But only when it is pulling water from the bottle to feel the reservoir.n But, for the price, it is a reasonable unit, and I have no major complaints with it!nRead Less Bottom Load Water Dispenser It was everything it said it was. Exactly what I wanted.n Five star rated. Excellent. Best product recommended for every home and offices.n Never would recommend!!! This machine sounds like an air compressor when siphoning up the water to dispense. It looks great, I'll give it that but the noise that it makes is horrible. So much that we can't close the front because it will wake our kids up when it needs to bring water up into the tanks. We are very unhappy with this product and will NEVER buy a GB product again. We have even moved it all over our kitchen to make sure the loud noise wasn't occurring because it wasn't level or what not. We are very very dissatisfied with this product!!! I will give it one star only because it looks nice. We should have taken it back right away!!!n Bottom load water dispenser Very nice looking unit, clean design, easy to use and safety feature on the hot water is great for child safety.n The Best Water Dispenser We like the 3 water temp. Selections, ease of bottom loading & the stylish & slim design.n UPSET with missing part replacement I called customer service for a missing bottle cap at the top of the metal straw. The rep said she understood what I was asking for. Received a drip tray and grill instead of the cap for the water bottle. I have no way to seal around the top of the water bottle without it. I have already had the product about three weeks and still can not use it.n High quality, reliable product Right out of the box this item worked better than expected. After following the cleaning procedure, we loaded the bottled water and tested the kettle feature. The water heated up quickly (within the three minutes as advertised) and was piping hot for my tea. The cold water was nice and cold, without having to adjust it and the room temperature water was just that. The magnetic removable panel on the bottom was easy to remove and replace. Even if you don't get it straight on, it tends to slide in place once both sides are on. I also noticed the water jug was much easier to slide into the bottom, unlike other dispensers I've used in the past. I noticed there is a slight slope to assist getting the water bottle in with ease. The adjustable drinking straw reaches all the way to the bottom of the bottle leaving little to no water left once the bottle is empty.nRead Less Love the look & style,perfect on our kitchen counter.The col Love the look & style,perfect on our kitchen counter.The cold water is ice cold & the hot water is steaming hot.Like that the on & off switch is on the side of the unit.n Just set up today - easy install - hot water in 5 mins from Just set up today - easy install - hot water in 5 mins from start up - difficult to place full 3 gal bottle on unit without spillingn Does what it's suppose to.

We have for about a year since getting a new fridge that did not have a water dispenser (long story) been using large water dispensers in our fridge for nice cold water. It took up a ton of usable space we needed for food so when I saw this unit I immediately grabbed it. So much to say about this unit.First it has heating and chilled water settings. It takes about 5 minutes to get the hot water up to speed and about 25 minutes for chilled water. It will hold a 3 or 5 gallon water jug (I highly recommend OZONE WATER) It does not come with the water jug so you do need to purchase that. I would have loved to seen a Customer buys this with the unit but there was nothing.The hot water side has a child proof button that keeps kids from burning themselves and or accidentally being bumped. Chilled water side does not.Its a great looking unit. It has a water catch tray at the bottom so far I have not spilled a drop in it but its nice to have. It has a drain on the back side which is not overly convenient but i do not see the need to drain it. I now have been able to remove the water container from the fridge and have put my insta hot in the garage and now utilize this unit for my chilled or hot water needs. It makes a nice steaming cup of hot coffee. My roommate uses it for making instant oatmeal and soups. I see no bad here. I am looking for something better to set it on but over all for the price tag (and I have compared others) this unit is top notch and I highly recommend it!Also it has ready lights on the front. The far left shows power then heating then chilled water. if the light is lit it means its still heating or cooling the water> I have noticed the unit does hot the hot and cold very well without running the compressor much.nRead Less Simple in design and use, families will find this hot and cold dispenser really handy. Just reme... Simple in design and use, families will find this hot and cold dispenser really handy. Just remember you have to have a counter where it will fit with the 3 gallon bottle on top; the manufacturer suggests a table. Everyone, even a child, can use its simple paddle design for dispensing the water; just put the container against the paddle and gently push,,,presto! Hot or cold with clearly marked paddles. No need to worry about smaller children getting burned with the hot dispenser because there is a simple lock that children can't operate.Ideal for a small office setting as well as a home, you will find it useful and inexpensive to operate.n My wife has asked me a few times about getting a water cooler for her craft shop because sometime... My wife has asked me a few times about getting a water cooler for her craft shop because sometimes she needs water for her projects and sometimes for a drink of cold water and never thought how great it would be to have hot water also , so when we saw this counter top water cooler dispenser that also dispenses hot water , we decided to go for this model and liked it so much we also got one for our house also and they provide nice cold water and very hot water and even though we do not have any young children , the child safety lock is a plus and also like you can get it in black or white .n n/a Avalon Premium Hot/Cold Top Loading Countertop Water Cooler Dispenser with Child Safety Lock, Black. Itu2019s is a handsome appliance. The footprint is small. Has two recessed handles on opposite sides and a 70u201d power cord to provide plenty of reach for the 120v power outlet. It also has independent rocker power switches for the hot and cold on the left side of the unit. What a great feature for saving energy and safety. If you wish you could turn them on in the morning and have hot water fast. The water cools quickly. The evaporator coils are close to the back and it has a drain on the corner on the left side to drain the water from the unit. The front is very nice looking with 3 power LEDs one for the power, hot, and cold features. The drip tray is removable as well as the grill so they can be emptied and cleaned without much trouble. The cold side is blue and on the right side of the dispenser and the lever action is smooth. The hot is red and on the left side with a safety button you must also press to keep anyone from getting scalded, it's a smart setup and easy to use. Plenty of room for a tall glass under the valve. This uses either the 3 gallon or the 5 gallon water jugs. I did not know that you can buy those jugs empty and fill them with your favorite water and thatu2019s what we are going to do. Some water is better than others for brewing a great cup of tea or coffee, so we look forward to that level of control on our new machine. We are serious tea drinkers. n The unit is very quite. The red light goes out when hot. It took about 8 minutes for it to get hot. About the same for cool water. The photos were taken at 8 minutes. If you buy a bottle and it does not have a membrane on the bottle top so that the spike on the dispenser can pierce it, expect a mess when you flip bottle up. My bottle is open. I did find after sanitizing everything that the dispenser holds about 80% of a gallon. So after I rinsed it, I filled it with good water and then filled the balance plus the remainder in the jug and it was much less of a mess. I will get membranes so there is zero mess. It's the bottle I chose fault. I canu2019t be certain but think the hot water reservoir is large for safety and the plus of allowing several people at the watering hole to fill up. This is great, very pleased.nRead Less Well designed and manufactured water dispenser.

This was ordered online, and delivered to home. It arrived as scheduled. Setup was easy. I chose this model because it is one of the top rated bottom loading coolers. The pump only goes on when you are getting water, otherwise cooling motor is very quiet. I only use the cooling side, not the hot water. I had a top loading model and I do NOT miss having to clean up the little water which always gets spilled. It's easy, just insert the \"straw\" into the bottle then slide it in. There are four switches on the back -- one for cold, one for hot, one for the nightlight. and one for a cleaning cycle. I like the flat top, where I keep my cups, and the fact that it doesn't have a big ugly bottle sticking out the top. And its easy for the kids to use, because I find half full cups of water all over the house and outside. Overall, I'm glad I got this unit and not a cheaper top loader.nRead Less Little disappointed with the cold water does not get cold enough, also hard to fill a pot . Have...

It makes hot water instantly so the coffee lover or tea lover gets their fix with less hassle, and less time (that's the best part for my bottom line). The cooler is stylish, and actually a bit small, which helped me because I was able to find a place to put it in my crowded break room. It took a few hours to install due to some routing of the pipe, and a trip to my hardware store to get a short extension piece to extend the pipe from the sink cabinet to the cooler's final location. We had an outlet close by so that helped. n The cooler has a safety feature on the hot side where you have to depress the button and lever to get the hot water, surely to make it hard for kids to get burned if they play with it. The cooler spouts are low so kids can get to it. There is a door on the front you open to get to the filter. The Avalon replacement filter is available from Home Depot for $72, and it says it lasts 3 months and 750 gallons of water running through it. I would guess you could get longer time and more gallons to save a few bucks, it's up to you. We noticed an improvement to the city water through the filter, but it didn't make it perfect, there was still a little taste of something.n There is no drain, only a small tray to hold water so don't overfill or you will have a mess to clean up. One issue we have had is there seems to be a ratting sound that has gotten worse lately. It is probably the filter door because if you touch the door it stops. In a few days we will get our energy bill and then we will see how much power it uses since it is running all the time to keep the cooler function ready.nRead Less Pros - After 2weeks seems to be a good...

Got the Avalon Bottle-Less, Self-Cleaning Water Cooler Dispenser with Filter, as a replacement for an older cooler we had. Like other reviewers said, the instructions were kind of confusing and could be a little more clearer. But together, we were able to figure out the installation process. Filter easily snaps into it's holder and is hidden from view inside the base of the cooler, a big plus. But produces what in my opinion would be called cool water and more than hot enough on the hot side. The hot dispenser also has a button on it which has to be pressed before hot water will be dispensed as a safety measure to prevent small children from getting burned. The only thing in my opinion should be changed is the diameter of the outlet in which the water comes out. It seems a little small, which makes the dispensing of water a little slow, once again I'm only comparing it to the one we had previously. While I'm reviewing, I would also like to give a shout out to the excellent customer service. When we first got the cooler, after a week the cooler stopped dispensing water and it was determined by Avalon that the cold water tank wasn't filling. They immediately sent me a replacement and after receiving it packed up the old first one and sent it back at no cost to me. Replacement is running beautiful. Thanks again Avalon.nRead Less I got this bottle less water system because we buy a lot of bottled water and now we do not have ... I got this bottle less water system because we buy a lot of bottled water and now we do not have to do it anymore. Plus my husband is disabled and in the bed most of the time so we just hooked it up in the bedroom right by the bathroom. It works very well. I did have to get someone to install it but it seemed to go smoothly. I really like the night light feature for using at night. Our kids are grown but the secure feature on the hot water is useful. It comes with one water filter. Lastly the self cleaning is awesome.n This review is for the Avalon Bottle-Less, Self-Cleaning Water Cooler Dispenser with Filter - Hot...

This machine is great mostly because it has no need for the large heavy bottles. It seems to be made with pretty good quality. The only thing I'm not crazy about on this unit is that it didn't come wit a cap to bypass the filter it came with. I installed a large capacity filtration system for my refrigerator and I'm using it on this unit as well. No only is it redundant, it is unnecessary and a waste of money in my case. If you don't have such an outboard filter, than the buil-in filter is necessary. Overall, this is a good unit at a pretty good price.n CHEAPER THAN CRYSTAL SPRINGS! I bought this for my medical office because I was tired of paying Crystal Springs $200.00 a month. Love this water cooler! Machine is quiet and sleak.n We are simply amazed by the Avalon Water Cooler Dispenser. We love the clean, contemporary look o... We are simply amazed by the Avalon Water Cooler Dispenser. We love the clean, contemporary look of this water cooler/dispenser, whichis equally suitable in an office environment, kitchen, family room or man cave.n We got this appliance as part of our plan to drink more water and less sugary drinks and juices, and it will definitely help us meet that goal.n Not only does it dispense pure filtered and tasty chilled water, but it also dispenses hot water, heated to 185 degrees, perfect for making tea with zero wait time. In fact, this feature may get more use in our house than the chilled water.n This product arrived well packaged, double-boxed to prevent shipping damagne. Included were two manuals, (one on installation and one on the filtration system itself), a large charcoal filter good for 6 months use, a roll of white PE tubing, and specialized 3-way stainless steel connector/shutoff valve - everything you need to install it, except for some white teflon tape,and your own adjustable wrenches.n It takes up very little floor space, so the main factor in the location is accessibility to a water connection. We opted to install our water cooler in our studio/family room, which was easily accomplished due to an existing faucet hose connection next to the well water tank. So, in our case, all we had to do was hook up a garden hose and flush the system, then attach the 3-way shutoff valve using some special fittings (also available at Home Depot - Everbilt 3/8\" dishwasher elbow, P/N LFA-158A and Everbilt 3/8\" cap LFA-105), along with some white teflon tape (not provided).n Of course, installation requirements will vary for each situation, and those who are not well versed in connecting water filters, dishwashers and faucets, may want to just pay a plumber to do this for you, as it is a moderate difficulty task for the DIY-er. Given that the entire installation took us only about 60 minutes, start to finish, it should not cost a lot to get this professionally installed, and is well worth it.n Once you get the special 3 way stainless steel valve/connector properly installed and leak-free, the rest of the installation is a snap.Just flush the new filter out and install the white PE poly tubing. Avalon supplies a special white plastic adapter that attaches to the included charcoal filter, so you can flush that new charcoal filter for 5 minutes into your sink before installing it. (We used a lobster pot instead, and a 5 gallon paint bucket would also work, as it's about 3 gallons of water required for the first flush.)n Next, you connect the white PE tubing to one port on the 3 way connector, and the other end connects to the back of the water cooler. There is even an extra plastic shutoff valve inside inside the bottom half of the water cooler, which also serves as storage space for the filter housing, manuals, adapters, etc.n Once water is flowing into the unit, you can flush through the cold water side of the dispenser on the front to get out any excess air, and then turn on the internal compressor which both cools and heats the water at the same time. It's quite an ingenious design, and best of all it's Energy Star-rated.n Cold water is almost immediately available, and heated water for tea becomes available after the unit has run for about one hour and the internal heat exchanger is fully heated up.n This incredible water cooler appliance also comes with an ozone-based self-flushing cleaning option, which you can use every few weeks to clean out the interior of the cooler, to ensure that there is no build-up of bacteria inside the internal components. The manufacturer also provides instructions on how to dissemble the cooler, sanitize it and remove mineral deposits, which should be done quarterly, especially when using hard water like we have.n Another great feature is the hot water on/off button which must be pressed before pressing your cup or glass against the red lever on the front of the dispenser to get hot water. This extra safety feature prevents possible scalding from the 185 degree water, which is essential in homes where there are children, who might be tempted to press on the hot water lever. They also include a special plastic strap, so you can strap this unit to the wall, so it cannot topple over, which is great for those with young children, or for anyone who lives in an earthquake zone, like the Pacific Northwest.n In fact, the only \"con\" we encountered, and it was very minor, was the product manual, which could use some revisions in content, grammar and more detail on the installation process. Also, there are a couple errors in the manual - for example, it states that hot water is available 15 minutes after the device is first turned on with water pressure, and cold water takes up to 90 minutes, but in fact it is the reverse: cold water is available first.n Installation manual aside, we found this water cooler/heater/dispenser to be an attractive and outstanding product. It would make a great Christmas gift for the home or office. It's a well-designed and well-made appliance all around that's well worth the price. We are quite thrilled with it.nRead Less This is a USA owned company and they proudly warrant the product and give you an easy to reach te... This is a USA owned company and they proudly warrant the product and give you an easy to reach telephone number. I am really impressed with the cooler. I attached the included tubing to my cold water in the basement and ran it to the cooler in the garage. It is perfect for our home with disabled children who can now get cold water anytime they want it (after I demonstrated its use). The water is so cold I no longer use ice cubes in my glass. It was a really simple install, the company having set up all the tubing inside. I simply attached the cold water tubing, screwed the filter in, flushed it as recommended and it was done. I might mention the safety \"trigger\" on the hot water paddle. It will not dispense water hot enough to make tea or an instant hot drink, until the button or trigger is pushed. A great safety feature for our home. BTW, the night light is a great addition that one can switch off or on.nRead Less 5 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern Cold water is barely cooler than room temperature.

What a nice addition to our kitchen! Before this we were using a Keurig that needed to be filled up with water every day and you were always waiting for the water to heat up. Now we don't have to fill anything up, since this water cooler is hooked up to our water line that we already had running to our refrigerator. The great part is now we always have hot water, room temperature water, and cold water ready to use at the touch of a button!! Actually you don't even need to touch the button you can just put your finger in front of the button and it starts working! In addition there is a night light for added convenience. Included in this product is a carbon filter and sediment filter as well as a built in UV light filter! We have noticed that the \"Large, Medium and Small\" dispense buttons, actually dispense noticeably less water than the stated amounts. Also the cold and room temperature buttons will keep dispensing until you press them again to stop the water so pay attention or you will overflow your cup! The hot button has a safety feature that will only dispense when your finger is on it so you can't just keep the water running if you walk away from the machine. Installation was fairly easy with instructions to follow (took approx. 30-45 mins). Also be patient after hooked up, it takes some time to fill up and gt to the right temperatures but once that is done it works great!!

I decided to buy my own water cooler and bottles to try and save some money. It arrived in a timely fashion. My husband and I set it up and followed all of the instructions. After 1 1/2 hours, the hot was working fine, but the cold water came out lukewarm/cool, not cold. I called the company and spoke to a customer service agent. He pooh-poohed me and told me that I probably didn't set things up correctly and didn't have it running long enough (even though the instructions say 1 hour). He said to run it over night and it would be just fine in the morning. It wasn't. By the morning, the cold was coming out warm/hot. I called the company again and they told me that I need to ship it back to them so that they can evaluate it and then they would then send me a new one. I asked it they could send someone out to service it and they said that they do not have service people. It's a good thing that I found out now and didn't buy the extended service plan because there is no service available. Forget it. I'm not waiting for a product that should have been running right out of the box. I reinstated my delivery service and this cooler is going back to Home Depot. And I really don't appreciate being spoken to in a condescending manner and treated like a stupid woman from that CS department guy. I've had water coolers for 20 years - I know how to set up and operate one by now.nRead Less Easy to load. Simple to clean and the water stays nice a cold, but it can be adjusted Easy to load.

I adjusted the dial on the back as recommended but water is barely cold. Would not this name brand ever again.n It sucks Buttons too hard to push.Buttons suck finger into vent hole and pinch upon release. Hurts!Poor design.n Not worth the money. Kept leaking from the cold water dispenser. Followed all the troubleshooting instructions but nothing worked. Had to keep a cup in place to catch the water. The buttons were a bit too hard to push. Also the height is just way off, it's more for like a child. It's just not very well made.n Better Than Expected Good deal for the price. Hot and cold water working in minutes. Took advantage of the free delivery as well. Only one small drawback, when you replace the water bottle, the reservoir is more shallow than other units therefore if you don't replace quickly, you will have water all over the place. Overall, very happy with the unit, wife and daughter love it.n Piece of Junk Do not buy this product unless you are a gambler. Unpacked the product, went through the complete sanitization procedure, installed water bottle. Flipped on hot water switch. Waited for hours, No hot water. Pushed the reset button, just to make sure. Waited for hot water and the \"hot light\" to come on. Nothing. Had to re-box the water dispenser and take it all the way back to Home Depot. Waste of my time.Home Depot needs to get this product off the shelf.n Does the Job It works well it is a little noisey when heating or cooling.n great water dispenser worked straight out of the boxguests were using it that day.n hot water also very goodn Works ok, but has flaws This is not a terrible unit from my experience, but it definitely has it's flaws, similar to what others have mentioned.n *review written after 1+ year of usen Pros*Price is reasonable and home depot offers extended warranty(I did not get wnty)n *Keeps cold water very cold and hot water very hotn Cons*Water flow is extremely slow for a unit with a dispensing button that requires a lot of pressure. While the water flow is one of the slowest I've seen, the few extra seconds to fill a cup isn't a deal breaker for me. However, when filling large containers, the amount of pressure required to hold the button down is very annoying when combined with a slow flow, even for a younger male as myself. I would not suggest this product for an older person or someone with arthritis in their hands.n *Cold dispensing button got stuck down and spilled a gallon of water on the floor while I was in another room. Issue was fixed by spraying button with some cooking spray to lubricate, but could have potentially done major damage to a wood floor.n *Red hot water \"ready\" light stopped illuminating after about 6 months (not big deal to me as it still heats the water just fine and I rarely use the hot water function)n Other than these couple of issues, I have had no problems with the unit. If you are a family that use several bottles per week, I would not recommend this product, but for an individual or light family use, this will work just fine.nRead Less Glacier Bay Hot/Cold Water Dispenser Smaller than previous (GE) dispenser. Shorter, so I don't have to lift the bottles so high! Appreciate that, let me tell you. Water even seems colder! Mrs. Bonnelln Best thing ever love it HOT AND COLD WATER DISPENSERWe love our new hot and cold water dispenser it works great.It's great for coffee or hot chocolate in a instantOr a nice cold glass of water is right at your fingertips.My grandkids can use it with no problems or worrys.We are very happy with this water dispenser love the looks love the way it fits in a small spaceThis is a great buyn water cooler This seems to be a good value.Iam happy with its quietness and how cool the water comes outn Not so good. It constantly drips water from the dispenser. Don't buy it.n Works Great I have always wanted a hot/cold water dispenser for my kitchen. I had chosen this one here and am very glad I did. This model is not too big or too small for my kitchen. The instructions were easy to read and understand. It was easy to install. The cold water is nice and cold, the hot water nice and hot. I can now drink and enjoy fresh water instead of from the tap. No need for ice cubes either which is a plus for me :)n A nice no frills water cooler We have been using this for about a week now and are wishing we would have got one sooner. It isn't as sleek as the under the unit models but that wasn't high on our priority list. We have well water with a very high iron content so prefer not to drink our tap water. I am surprised at how fast we are going through water now which is great, I would rather see the kid go get a nice glass of cold water then reach for a Mountain Dew. The temperature is adjustable for the cold water, we set ours about 3/4 of the way and it is ice cold. I measured the temperature of the hot water and it is right at 150 degrees, perfect for my morning tea. The hot water button is child proof so no worries about accidents. When it does run to cool the water it is quiet, hardly noticeable at all unless you are listening for it. Saves money on buying bottled water, we just refill em and put em in the fridge to grab on the go. So far this has been a great addition to our kitchen.nRead Less Decent for the price So, I read the reviews and decided to take a chance on this unit. Unpacked and setup per the instructions and ran the initial cleaning, but as others have stated, the hot would not work. So, i took it back and tried another one. Same thing happened on the initial cleaning, hot would not work. The manual states to clean with no bottle in and I was hesitant to try putting a bottle on if it was not going to work. So, I decided to call the 800 help line. The support rep knew of my problem immediately and stated there is an error in the guide and apologized. In order for the hot to work, you must have a bottle loaded and the pressure needs to build. So, I put the bottle on and sure enough the hot worked after it \"charged\".n I like that you can turn off the hot water feature when you are not using it.nRead Less Nice Compact Dispenser I've had this dispenser almost a month and had absolutely no problems with it. I love the small footprint which allowed me to get rid of a countertop water filter taking up precious space. Several reviews mentioned the buttons sticking and causing water leakage, I have not had that problem and don't know if it is something that happened over time. My only problem with the dispenser buttons is that they are very tough to push and hold while filling and I have actually had my finger pinched once when releasing the hot water button. Not a big deal for me, but for the kids I make sure to remind them to watch their fingers.n Other reviews mentioned that the drip tray was not removable for dumping and washing, that is not true. Since it was all put together when I took it out of the package I almost thought it did not come out, but a little tug was all it took for it to come out and get washed and it was simple to replace.n I like this unit and definitely recommend it for those who need a slim/small water dispenser that does hot and cold water. I have not found it to be too noisy or had any problems with the flow of water. The hot water has been perfectly hot, I have been able to make coffee in my french press with no problems. But once again, I've only had the unit a month and for long term issues would refer to reviewers who have had problems after the 90 day- 6 month marks.n Although I recommend it, I am returning it because I've \"upgraded\" to a bottom load model. We used this a lot more than I anticipated and I was getting tired of having to stoop so low to fill our water bottles because the dispensing area is pretty much toddler height- the consequences of a top loader in general, no fault of the model itself. With the bottom loader the dispenser part is higher up and I also like not having the water bottle visible Plus the model I went with for the upgrade offers the ice cold plus room temperature option, something I prefer because I was keeping the temp of the water on this model at the lowest setting and still putting water in the fridge for others in the house who wanted the ultimate cold. If I had a bigger house and room for a second unit I would definitely keep it, but for now I only need one.nRead Less Beware!

It is simple and easy to use for the whole family!n Great price Great price and works well if you want to own your own water cooler other than renting. Ready to go right out of the boxn Waste of money... I will be short and to the point. The dispenser button for the cold water always sticks and either over flows your glass of water or will flood your kitchen with gallons of water if you dont realize its still dispensing. The metal sides are extreamly cheap and dentable, just by picking the dispener to pour the water out of the top during cleaning I dented both sides where my hands held on to it. The top over flow cap says you can remove to clean it by it is impossible. Good luck with this pile....n Love everything about it! Love everything about it!n The whole family love this product.

All you do is plug it in the wall. Put the jug on top, press your cup against the spout and you're good to go.

We love it! easy to set up, and easy to use.n Terrible I got this dispenser because I liked the look. The hot water works. But that's the end of the positive things about it. n The water will not get cold. The plastic base is also literally crumbling apart. Every time I push a button a part of the plastic base crumbles off. The dispenser is now tilting precariously. It's been less than 1 week since I bought it. I'm taking it back. This is a terrible waste of money.n Stylish design, great functionality. This water dispenser looks great and would fit in great with any office (we use dispensers throughout our home because the water quality where we live is awful). It is a great feature that the hot water side can be locked to insure safety when small children are around. The only draw back with this machine is if you have an oversized container, it does become a two-handed operation because you have to hold your container and press the dispense button on the top of the machine.n Excellent water dispenser The dispenser came very well packaged and was in perfect condition out of the box. There is a power switch on the back to enable hot water production. The hot water trigger includes a safety release to protect from accidentally dispensing hot water; a good child safety feature. There are two small lights on the front of the unit that illuminate - red when hot water is ready and blue when cold water is ready. The hot water was available in maybe 10-20 minutes. The cold water took a little longer and was ice cold.n The unit is a slim design, very nicely finished and operates quietly.n Excellent Purchase Our old water dispenser completely died in the middle of the day. This was purchased online and ready for pick up, set up was easy and we have water now.n not good at all for refilling water bottles water is nice and cold but difficult to refill water bottles . only good for cup s. you have to bend to line up to spigot as this model is so much shorter .n Just what I need this Summer A great Hot/Cold Water Dispenser. Perfect size for the kitchen, living room, bedroom or even the balcony. It's white so it'll go with any decor. I love the height too. I'm 5 feet and can place the 3 (or 5) gallon water bottle on it myself. The cold water is cold and the hot water is hot, as described. Has push button operation w/child safety lock for hot water. Anti-Leak Bottle Support Collar. And best of all, is Energy Star. Now I can have cold water or hot green tea in an instant - when I want it.n Compact and attractive I have been around several water coolers in my day. This unit by Glacier Bay is a real standout! It is compact, attractive and offers not only cold water but hot water as well. A control knob on the back lets you select the cold water temperature.There is an off and on power switch also on the back to engage the hot water. The only problem I encountered was during the initial cleaning procedure. You have to remove the bottle support collar. I could not do it. It was too hard to get a hold of. My husband was able to remove the collar. From then on everything was fine. The dispenser works quietly and efficiently! I am happy to recommend this product.n Small, weak and Horrible Water cooler I bought it and when I got home and took out of box was so small that looked like a Barbie Water Cooler, also looked like such weak dispenser that I was afraid if I put the water bottle the dispenser was going to crack, do not recommend this product as definite will not last long. Cheap made.n Fits in Narrow Space This hot/cold water dispenser fits in a narrow space of less than 11 inches wide and 12 inches deep which is great because that was the only space I had left. The instructions had lots of pictures and no words and were a little confusing. The product comes with a bottle piercing tip as some water vendors seal the jugs or have a puncture top to them. The tower came with a collar to help balance the jug and holds the 5 gallon jugs (not included). The hot dispenser requires a switch in the back be turned on. There is an adjustment for cooler temperature. Once step suggest rinsing the cooler / lines with vinegar and water equal parts. The problem was the cooler does not drain 100% so a lot of water was used to flush the vinegar out. It is a nice cooler for a small space.nRead Less Great water dispenser!! Finally a we have a stylish water dispenser, no more drinking well water!! This unit will hold a 3 or 5 gallon water bottle. It has a thermostat on the back to adjust the coldness of water, very easy to operate with the push of a button. This unit also dispenses hot water, there is a safety switch on the back to turn off the hot water when not in use with a child safety switch on the front. The unit has a red light for hot water and a blue light for cold water. We love this unit, we have been using it for 5 days without any issues.n Great water cooler and heater! We got this Hot and Cold water dispenser to use at my wife's office. She loves this unit and so do her coworkers. You can get hot or cold water on demand. There is a blue light for cold and a red light for hot. As long as the light is on the water will be either cold (Blue light) or red (red light). The water is chilled and you can control the temperature via a thermostat on the rear of the unit. You can also turn off the heater for the hot water via a switch on the rear of the unit. The hot water dispenser has a childproof feature for dispensing. The whole office is happy with this unit and they all would recommend it!n Works better then I expected Reading some of the mixed reviews I thought It wouldn't work very good but I took a chance anyway. It works great the cold water isn't ice cold but it is plenty cold enough. And it can be adjusted. The hot water has a child safety system that makes it harder for little guys to turn on. The hot water isn't boiling but its fine for hot chocolate for the kiddies. Its smaller then some I have seen but that makes it easier to put the 5 gallons jugs on it. I bought a 3 gallon with a handle (also sold by HD) so that I can get my own free well water. I'm not sure where the UV inhibitor is but that is a big plus. We have one on our pond and well water system. Its stop the growth of algae which could happen if the water is sitting around for a long time.nRead Less Nice water cooler The hot and cold water dispenser is very nice. The water is both nice and cold and very hot. I put the water dispenser in my work shop so I can stay hydrated while working on my projects. The hot water is hot enough to make a cup of tea or instant coffee right out of the water dispenser. The water dispenser is quiet enough to have it in your din, kitchen, or play room. The child safety for the hot water is secure.n Excellent value Can't live with out it in Florida excellent cooler works greatn Easy to setup, easy to use It's one of those plug and play kind of item. Once you plug it in you can get hot and cold water dispensing from each spigot. Easy to setup. There is no mess with the leak proof bottle support system. If you are tall then you might have a bit of hard time reaching the bottom to put your cup or glass in. Otherwise this is good for the whole family. Kids can reach it and average size adults can too.n Compact Dispenser After having a water dispenser for year and to lift the five gallon bottles on top, this one made it easy. It short and compact but it does hold five gallon bottle. I was a bit worry because bending over bother my back but on it was put in place there no bending necessary. It take a little work to get it started but other than that it works like a charm.n Really enjoying it.... Once we learned how to work it .....Good deal.....n Quiet and cold Works very well and is quiet. Non-obtuse design fits well and blends in. Very inexpensive and as the compressor does not sound off.n first time try the wayer Dispenser It work great and is easy to set up and use. I would recommend this product to anyonen Always leaking after filling jug I love the ease of having a hot/cold water dispenser in my home; however, whenever you place a new, fresh jug on top of the dispenser, it WILL leak when you go to retrieve your water. It would be an easy fix if the cold button didn't jam, but that's the reason the leak happens. It could be the pressure of the lack of friction between the button and the dispenser itself, but the button used to dispense water gets stuck, and there you are frantically trying to get the button to pop up.n I would NOT recommend this product to anyone, especially if you have children in the home.n Water Dispenser We got this as an alternative to tap water or water bottles. The hot water is hot enough for instant coffee or a cup of tea or hot chocolate. It is a little low to the ground but for the price its something we could live with.n Looks good, but... Love the sleek design and low height. n However... even with it's most inconspicuous design, it is the elephant in the room. IT IS SO LOUD, guests ask, \"Where's that sound coming from?\" At times, I've had to unplug it to get to sleep. n The buttons are also a negative feature. They look good, but for an arthritic person they are more difficult to work, than tabs. And the hot water has never worked.n I've decided to move this unit to my office, and am shopping now, for a better model for my home. This time, I'm reading the reviews, and won't cheap out for the least expensive. Any recommendations?n Does the job for a good price It makes colder water than its predecessor, but the compressor is a bit noisy when running. Needs better shock mounts.n Happy so far.... Bought this for work. We use it a lot. The cold is cold enough and the hot is fine as well.n terrible product. I bought this unit almost 6 months ago and have never been pleased. It is loud! Makes banging sounds when heating water that can be heard from across the building. Won't fill the hot reservoir if there is less than 1.5 gallons in the carboy. The lines are plastic and make the water taste like plastic even when the carboy is glass. Does not cool to a low enough temperature or heat to high enough to make a cup of tea. The buttons only work when compress completely into the machine which isn't easy while supporting a glass or bottle with the other to fill.n Water cooler Water comes out too slow. Push buttons are too stiff. The cooler is kind of short. Gotta bend over too far to get water. Shelf that holds cup is not tall enough for very tall water bottle. Have to hold bottle the whole (slow) process of filling.n Commercial Client Satisfied This product was one specified by our client and they are extremely happy with it. It does what it says and without fuss. What else can one desire?n Not a bad unit Doesn't seem to be a bad unit, a little noisey at times. There is a little rattle when the condenser kicks on (to chill water) nothing excessively loud but is noticeable. Would not put along a wall that shares a bedroom. Besides that instant hot or cold water. Hot water has a safety button that at first I found annoying but now I don't even seem to notice.n Piece of junk Cold water died 3 months after warranty. Home Depot tried to work with manufacturer but Glacier Bay not interested. Unfortunately the same unit is marketed under several names. Be careful.n Dayana I love it doesn't take a lot of space and the hot water that comes out is super hot and has a safety feature just in case you have kids.

Self-Cleaning Bottom Loading Water Cooler Dispenser, Whiten A NICE WATER DISPENSERBACKGROUND: This is the third water dispenser we have owned. It is an addition to go in our upstairs rental apartment.REVIEW: This is a nice, simple unit. The bottom water bottle storage is very nice and keeps the unit sleek and clean looking. The unit can use 3 or 5-gallon bottles which is very convenient. Three indicator lights show if the heater, cooler, or self-clean feature are in operation. There is an outlet for chilled water and one for hot water. The chilled water control is a simple push lever; press your container against the lever and water flows. Our 2-year-old grandson quickly learned how to fill his water cup. The hot water dispenser has a simple safety, you must press the button on the top of the lever, then press the lever. Our grandson has not learned to operate the hot water. The water is hot enough to steep tea, make hot chocolate, and start Ramen noodle soup. The unit does not have a room temperature water dispenser. The self-clean feature is a nice addition. Press the self-clean button on the back and the unit generates Ozone into the water to sterilize the system. The u201cPower/Self-Cleanu201d indicator flashes to show the system is cleaning.SUMMARY: An attractive, simple, convenient unit.PROS: 3 or 5-gallon bottles fitSelf-clean functionCONS: No room-temperature water dispensernRead Less We have owned several top-load water coolers in the past, however this is our first bottom load m... We have owned several top-load water coolers in the past, however this is our first bottom load machine. The appearance is improved, as this cooler is better looking without the big jug sitting on top. It is a high quality product that we are happy with as it delivers much colder water than any of our old machines, the bottom loading means less lifting and no chance of spilling water on the floor. Also, the probe does a great job of emptying all the water out of the jug, and the empty jug indicator is a great feature.n The self-cleaning bottom loading water cooler dispenser is just what I needed. I have always owne... The self-cleaning bottom loading water cooler dispenser is just what I needed. I have always owned a top loading water cool and with five gallon water bottle it is a little difficult but this makes my job lighter while being easy to load. I love the fact of control switches on back for light, hot and cold water and self cleaning. It allows you to have it your way.n I picked this one because we really like the other bottom loading water cooler we have, and wante... I picked this one because we really like the other bottom loading water cooler we have, and wanted another for the office. It is much easier to load the water into and no longer need to lift the 5 gal jugs (which makes my wife happy). The self cleaning feature I'm not too sure about yet, but time will tell. the pump is a little loud while loading water the first time, but not to the point of being concerning.n This is a very smartly and well designed hot/cold water dispenser. The best feature is that it is... I love this innovative water cooler. You put the water bottle in the bottom right side up. No more heavy lifting and spilling while trying to get that heave bottle over the hole on the top. Itu2019s easy to use with the paddle like spouts u2013 just press your cup or glass against the paddle and the water comes out. It has an efficient compressor that makes the cold water really cold. The hot water is hot enough to make tea, instant coffee or other u201cjust add wateru201d hot drinks. There is a child safety lock on the hot dispenser so that children donu2019t accidently get burned. There is a built-in nightlight so that you can see the spouts in the dark if you want to use this feature. It has a light that tells you when to replace the filter. It also cleans itself! It has a self-cleaning ozone feature that sanitizes and purifies the dispenser. This cooler can use the 3 or 5 gallon bottles. This is perfect for our guests so that they donu2019t have to come upstairs to get filtered water.nRead Less This water dispenser cooler/heater is great. No more top loading bottles that are hard to lift a... This is a very smartly and well designed hot/cold water dispenser. The best feature is that it is bottom loading, meaning you donu2019t have to lift the 3 to 5 gallon bottle more than a few inches. Better than that, you also donu2019t have to flip the bottle up-side-down! That is a major u2018smartu2019 design feature. Another great consideration is the self-cleaning feature. While I donu2019t understand it (a chemist could explain it I suppose), by pressing the u2018Ozoneu2019 button in the back, ozone is injected through the system to kill germs and bacteria. Yet another feature I like is the ability to turn on/off the night light, the water heater, and the water cooleru2014thus saving electricity if you donu2019t need one or more of these. It will save money spent on bottled water (i.e., the personal single size ones). While I consider this a u2018luxuryu2019 at home, it is a great addition for an office or lunch room.nRead Less Avalon you have no ideal how much money you save me with your attractive, neatly compact, smart, ... This water dispenser cooler/heater is great. No more top loading bottles that are hard to lift and sometimes leak when installing. Just simply open the bottom door and install the pick-up tube into the new bottle,the dispenser comes with features that cool and heat water, There is a nightlight so you can dispense at nighttime.

Avalon you have no ideal how much money you save me with your attractive, neatly compact, smart, self cleaning water dispenser.I was not aware I had the option to store a 5 gallon or if needed only a 3 gallon huge bottle of water underneath hidden in a stored compartment. There is no way I could have ever picked up that size bottle and flipped it over to stick on the top of the dispenser as seen on display in offices, doctors offices everywhere!The entire size of the dispenser to store fresh clean water is less than countertop height and fits nicely in a corner in my didning room. I can now grab cold fresh glass of water as I walk out my back door in the hot summer days here in Florida, I can't get enough water! I was spending a fortune on bottled water.n This is perfect for any family, any sized home or apartment, requires so little space. I think of how many plastic bottles are being used I'm doing our planet a huge favor by making a small change.n I leave the dispenser plugged in at all times, it's silent. I have the option to flip a switch for ice cold water or flip a switch (this blows my mind) for hot water for a cup of tea, I mean it really gets hot! Instructions read 15-20 minutes but seemed faster. I no longer have to turn on the stove top and boiled water in my tea kettle. Avalon made drinking healthy easy, super easy! The 3rd switch is a Night lite. When the machine is running to warm water or to cool water (I'm fine with room temperature most of the time) the motor is very faint in sound as if a small fan is running.nRead Less This water cooler is very nice looking, easy to set up and I I chose this model because it is one of the top rated bottom loading coolers. The pump (operated by a compressor) brings the water up to the water collector and only goes on when the water is depleted. The unit is very quiet. I had been using a top loading model and it was difficult to load and also my back isn't in the best shape to lift the five gallons. This is SO EASY to load!! Just put the water probe into the bottle and press down, then slide into the bottom of the cooler. That's it!! No lifting. When the water is cooling or heating, the green or red light comes on. When the bottle gets low, a flashing red light will let you know. There are three switches on the back -- one for cold, one for hot, and one for a cleaning cycle. The taps are convenient, just press the glass against them. The hot water tap has a button lock to protect children getting burned. n Customer service is excellent. I had a question and was able to speak to someone right away for support. n Another plus is that the unit is very attractive and not too large. I only wish I had one years ago.nRead Less n/a This water cooler is very nice looking, easy to set up and I love the bottom loading of the water bottle. I have found that the room temp water is cool rather than room temp if the cold water switch is turned on. The unit is really quiet when heating water (I used to have to turn the heating element off on the prior dispenser because it was quite noisy). I did take the top panel screws out to clean it according to directions in manual before first use but I could not get the top off and it did look quite complicated so I took a chance on using it the way it came.

From straw being stainless steel instead of plastic to it being adjustable for different sized bottles so no parts to lose. Also love that water doesn't need to be constantly heating and will heat quickly as needed. Love the door feature so it's easier to load bottle. When we plugged it in, I did have an alarm go off. Tried moving it to a different spot. Still alarm went off. When I called customer service he said they were experiencing larger than normal calls. Tried to give me a different number to call, however, as I needed an answer right away decided to try to figure it out on my own. He did suggest I take it back.

The unit looks great, however, we're experiencing the following issues:n  1) Compressor kicks on and runs for a while every 5-7 minutes. This becomes a noise issue when you have the water dispenser next to dinning table every time when someone sits there reading the morning newspaper. I call tech support, and they said to adjust the thermostat. Give me a break here, it is at the end of November when it is not that warm inside and the thermostat is not set at its cold-max.n 2) There is no such thing as \"room temperature\" water by pressing the middle button. It functions as another cold button since water comes out as cold as you press the \"cold button\". Tech told me the button might be misplaced with the cold water, \"holy cow\" -- what a silly answer to prove that Glacier Bay does not care about their QC (Quality Control).n I would not recommend this unit, choose another brand/product.

This is on our counter in our kitchen next to our refrigerator. This does have to have a dedicated water line running to it, so if you don't know how to do that on your own, you will have to hire somebody to hook it up for you. This wasn't an issue for us as we hadn't hooked up the water line to our refrigerator yet, so when we did that, we ran this one too and it's good to go.

One of the main features that I like is that it is charcoal filtered and from the research that I did, it is the best. Phoenix has the worst tasting water and is not drinkable to most peoples taste. The filter is replaced at 6 months or 1500 gallons but because of the water we have here, it might need to be done sooner.

Setup is easy, unit can be connected directly to your existing sink water line. All parts necessary for installation are included: NSF certified carbon filter, good for 6 months or 1500 gallons of water filtering. UL listed and meets Energy Star standards. Black cabinet color but also is available in white. The cooler dimensions are 12 in x 12 in x 19 in. The paddle spouts are easy to use; press your cup against the paddle to let water come out. Cold water comes out approximately 47ﹾ, cold enough to drink without ice cubes. Hot faucet is hot enough for tea or coffee at approximately 168ﹾ. For safety, a child safety lock on the hot water faucet is added. The hot water will not work without pressing safety hot water lock. No need to worry about accidental burns. The self-cleaning ozone feature sanitizes and purifies the dispenser, preventing the buildup of germs and bacteria. Another plus, there is a built-in nightlight that makes the water spouts visible at night. Also, a filter indicator will light up when the filter needs replacing. Overall this is an excellent unit.

The instruction manual is written well and easy to follow the steps once you have accessed the cold water supply line. The system has its own filtration system that installs ahead of the unit to make sure the water is fresh and clean. We have a whole house water filtration system attached to the main water line so this is more of a backup filtration for us. The install was pretty straight forward and the unit works exceptionally well. The cold water is very cold and the hot is very hot. It has a safety feature to child proof the hot water valve and takes some getting used to. The combination unit is a great money saver. Previously we had used bottled water and as I get older the jugs seem to get heavier. This unit eliminates that hassle and is very stylish. It is well worth the price and is so handy to have around.nRead Less This review is for the Avalon Countertop Self Cleaning Bottle Less Hot/Cold Water Cooler. I am t... This review is for the Avalon Countertop Self Cleaning Bottle Less Hot/Cold Water Cooler. I am thrilled to own this cooler for many reasons. A very good reason to love this cooler is that it helps reduce your cost if you purchase bottle water. That in itself is reason to own this stylish modern looking Avalon Hot/Cold Self Cleaning Bottle Less Water Cooler.Another reason is that when you need hot water, for Cappuccino, Hot Chocolate, Tea, Oatmeal, instant Mac and Cheese, Cup of Soups etc, you do not get the coffee taste with your hot water, just pure hot water. That does happen sometimes with your coffee maker or Keurig, or whatever coffee maker you own.Another thing no grounds from coffee that i am so happy about. Let me tell you the hot water is hot, i am enjoying my Specialty Coffee Drinks so much, so easy to not have to go to my Keurig and get Hot Water, this is so much simple. This is a very stylish and modern looking Kitchen Appliance, takes up a bit of space, so if you do not have countertop space, you may want to think twice about getting this cooler. Do you want cold crisp water, well with this cooler you will get it at 47 Degree F, and also has a good taste. The Hot water is hot giving you 168 Degree F which is plenty hot water. Another nice feature about the hot water paddle, is that it comes with a child safety lock, for a child protection so that they do not get burn.We found that once you get the water valve; filter and the water line connected, all you do from that point is connect the water line to the back of the unit, turn the cooler on, and your ready to go. The most tedious part of course is the plumbing, if you have not done much plumbing, you may want to hire someone to install this cooler. But pretty simple and instructions are good. The instruction booklet explains to you how to clean the cooler every 3 months. The water filter in our case 2 improves the overall quality and taste while removing odors, chlorine, lead, and cysts. The recommendation is to change the water filter every 6 months.This is a bottle-less NSF Certified activated carbon filter in the cabinet and water line that can be attached to a water source included is faucet, filter, installation kit, spout, and wall mount. The cooler has an automatic shutoff, filter change indicator, indicator lights, twist and lock design. It weighs 31 lb.As i have stated the self cleaning feature, a self cleaning ozone feature sanitizes and purifies to prevent nasty jerms from accumulating.I am crazy in love with this cooler, and find i use it now more then our Refrigerator. It is so cool to see on our countertop, love that it is stylish and modern looking, love the nightlights and love that it serves our purpose.

I have it installed in the basement family room so no more running upstairs when I want some water. The water cooler install quickly. The previous home owner already had a water line which i just reused. So just had to plug it in and run water thru the filter. The cooler provides water at room temp., cold and hot water. Since it uses a filter that means no more dealing with heavy water bottles.n I AM SO FAR VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT. EASY... I AM SO FAR VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT. EASY TO INSTALL.

We haven't actually been able to install this item but I have a tech scheduled in a few weeks. The look and size of the cooler are ideal for our home. It's clean in appearance and without the bottle will not be an eye sore in the kitchen. The ability to add instant hot water will be great along with all the water being filtered. The fact that it is stainless steel in appearance also makes it a great fit to our other appliances. I will post and updated review once we have this product in full operation!n The AVALON Model A5BOTTLELESS self-cleaning botteless water dispenser is a self-contained unit th... The AVALON Model A5BOTTLELESS self-cleaning botteless water dispenser is a self-contained unit that as the description indicates does not require changing water bottles. It is plumbed directly into your incoming cold water line. The unit has an on board water filter which claims to remove greater than 97.4% chlorine, 0.5 to less than 1um (which is very small) or 99.7% particulate, 99.99% cyst, less than 0.5ug/L (also very small) lead at pH 6.5 and 0.9ug/L lead at pH 8.5. These are the technical specifications for the unitsu2019 filtration capabilities. In layman terms, this is a very good quality filtration system. We have been using the system for about two weeks (and we use it a lot) and the unit thus far has worked flawlessly. The water quality in our opinion is fantastic. The unit features a self-cleaning setting which when activated lasts for approximately 90 minutes and eliminates bacteria and bio-film in the holding tank and water lines. This is an extra added measure of safety for clean pure water. The unit dispenses hot, cold and room temperature water. The hot water is definitely hot enough to brew a good cup of tea. The cold water is chilled to about 50 degrees and is very refreshing. My entire family has used the system and we no longer purchase bottled water which is a huge plus. Not only do we not have to carry and store lots of heavy packages of bottled water, but we are not using tons of plastic which is definitely not good for the environment. In regard to installation, the unit comes with everything you need to set the system up for use. I have attached pictures indicating the plumbing required. Prior to installing the plumbing, ensure that you have shut off your cold water supply and that the two shut-offs, one at the plumbing tee and one where the filter attaches are also in the off position. It literally took me no more than 30 minutes to install this system. The unit comes with a tee fixture that attaches to your existing cold water line and a high quality water line that attaches to the rear of you dispenser. After the plumbing connections are secure, you must install the A4 filter which comes with the system. After installing the filter you would turn your cold water supply back on, open the shut off on the tee and finally open the shut off at the filter. The unit will fill the on board tank at this point. You are instructed to then dispense water from the unit for about 5 minutes which is roughly 2.5 to 3 gallons of water. Make sure to check for any leaks at the connections that you have made as well as the unit itself for any signs of leakage. After dispensing water for the recommended time you may then plug the unit in and turn the cold and hot water switches to on. When the unit is ready, the indicator light on the front will go out and you are ready to use the system. Another great feature is that the on board filter is stated as lasting for approximately 1500 gallons of water. The unit will indicate automatically when a filter change is required. In summary, the unit is easy to install, delivers high quality drinking water (great for coffee too), is extremely quiet. As stated, above, we have used the system for about 2 weeks now and have thoroughly enjoyed this new water system. Personally I would highly recommend the unit if it continues to perform as it has in the time we have had it. At a price of about $300, I feel that it is worth the cost for the convenience, high quality water and as an environmentally sound alternative to water in plastic bottles. I hope this review helps anyone contemplating purchasing a unit such as this. AVALON has made a really nice unit.nRead Less It was shipped very fast and was shipped securely.

All in all nice bottle less water cooler. self cleaningn The most convenient water dispenser We are so happy with our purchase of the Avalon self cleaning bottleless water dispenser. It was so easy to install, it literally took just a couple of minutes. The best part is that this is finally a water dispenser that the baby cannot reach. The buttons to dispense the water is on the top of the cooler, not at baby standing level. A great feature this dispenser has over others is that there is a room temp option. Also a great feature is that the hot water dispenser has a child lock so even if the baby were to climb onto a chair, he cannot burn himself. No more water bottle deliveries or lifting the heavy bottles to replace the empty one. There is a self-cleaning feature which keeps any bacteria from growing. It is a very easy to use feature. There is also a built in filter which filters out lead, chlorine, and rust. This is such a pretty and sleek dispenser too! I'm sure you will be very happy with you're purchase as we are with ours!nRead Less Cold or hot whenever you want it This water cooler ticks most of the boxes that I was looking for in a hot/cold water cooler. The following are the pros and cons:n Pros: - Does what it says - gives you cold and hot water on demand - Easy to set up - just hook it up to your water line - QuietCons - Size - given that it doesn't have the big bottle on the base, I feel like it could have been at least a foot shorter - the height (almost 4') may limit the places it can be stationed.n I really haven't had it long enough to evaluate the filter life or self-cleaning feature, but if they perform as well as the rest of the unit, it will be fine. All-in-all I'm very happy with it, but couldn't quite give it 5 stars due to the size being unnecessarily large (really 9/10 rather than 4/5).nRead Less Just Like Bottle Coolers w/o The Work or Mess I finally got this installed in my hanger. Other than running a new water line and flushing the filter the install went very fast. I have grandkids around so installed the rear extended feet and it is very stable. The filter is taking the place of the bottle, otherwise it is just like ones you find in offices. The plenty cold water is very much appreciated in Arizona just now (July 2) and the hot while not needed now seems easily hot enough for my tea in winter. In my early office years I dealt with those heavy bottles that piled up in the store room. I suspect offices are now changing over to this technology.Our water here is very good from the tap and I can taste no difference through the unit.nRead Less awesome water dispenser shipped double boxed with enough cushion to keep it from being damaged.n Vary tall and really cool reminds me of a unit in a doctors office or cafeteria.I think the best feature is that it does not need jugs of water as it runs off the house water.The included filter is rated for 1500 gallons or six months which ever comes first, I did not want to burn out the filter that comes with it so I teamed it up with a water filter system that also came from home depot.So the external system will pre-filter the water, extending the life span of the included filter.you should use the Self-Cleaning / Sanitizing button weekly. It takes 90 minutes to run through that cycle.Followed by 60 min. to get the temperatures back to normal operating temps for the cold and hot water.If your just using the included filter their is a red indicator light to let you know when it is time to change the filter.n If you have a apartment, condo, or slab house you might want to use it as the manufacturer recommends.it comes with a T fitting and a 120 volt plug.so just mount it near a sink or other source of cold water and a outlet on a flat surface.as it does not have adjustable feet.n Now if you have a house with a basement, go find where ever you want to put the unit remembering that it needs to be on a flat level surface and your going to have to run both power and water to it.Like ever other water cooler Only cold water should be run to the unit.It should be plugged into a 15 amp circuit as it has both a heating unit and a compressor for the coolant for the cold water.The hot and cold water are on demand which is why you have to wait for the unit to get to operating temperature.n Their is a drip tray for water from the dispenser, it must be manually emptied as their is no collection system in the lower compartment of the unit.Their is a red bobber indicator in the drip tray to let you know when it is almost full.n This unit is NOT exterior rated, so before you decide to put this unit out side, that must be taken into consideration.Just as long as it is protected from the elements and winter water temps. do not drop to freezing, their should be no issues using this just about where ever you want to.So if you have a shop where you work on what ever or a pool pump house, dressing rooms, rest rooms, etc.As long as it is protected from elements it will work fine.If anyone does decide to put it outside, planning on using a cover for the unit, do not forget to bolt it to the ground, as it is not so heavy that it can not be toppled by wind as it only weighs in at 50 lbs.nRead Less Awesome Water Dispenser RE: Avalon Bottle-Less, Self-Cleaning, Hot and Cold Water Coolern When I was shopping for this, I decided on the bottle-less model so I didn't have to handle those heavy bottles on a regular basis.n Dispenser was well-packed at the factory, shipped and arrived in great condition.n Installation was easy and straight forward. I installed it in my home kitchen near the sink and dishwasher. I installed a tee and connected from there.n The cold water is cold enough (for me anyway) that ice isn't required.n It even has a built in night light for those midnight water runs!n Easy to install and looks nice So far this hot/cold water cooler is great! Looks nice in the kitchen area. Makes really hot water fast. The cold water is cold enough that I did not need to add ice. Comes with most everything you need to install. I had to pick up a water valve that split off to connect the water cooler supply line. Filter is easy to access and change. Directions are clear and easy to follow. Install the water supply line was the most difficult and took the longest part of the install. After flushing the water filter for a bit the water was clear, cold or hot, with no taste or smell. Perfect for a small office or conference room.n 3 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern 4 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern 5 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern 4 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern 5 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern 5 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern 3 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern I am going on three years with this dispenser, it's still working fine and have not had one probl... I am going on three years with this dispenser, it's still working fine and have not had one problem. I recommend.n Works fine for a basic cooler This is a pretty basic water cooler, which at this price point is about as much as you can expect. Even though there is nothing particularly fancy about this it does dispense cold water and that's what I wanted it for. I love seeing the kids fill up a glass of water to drink instead of reaching for a soda or juice. Make sure you follow the directions and rinse it out with a vinegar/water solution before you use it to get any plastic taste out.n Easy to use, cools and heats water nicely It's a water cooler/heater and it does what it is intended to do. Set up is easy. Just be near an outlet if you want to heat or cool the water. And there is a bracket that mounts to the floor and unit to help prevent it from tipping over. Other than putting a 3 or 5 gallon jug of water on it these is nothing to do to set it up. n If the bottled water that you use is laden with minerals and would be considered hard water you may need to do some service/maintenance on the hot water side to remove scale and mineral deposits, but that looks easy to do. The toughest part of this is getting the jug of water on the dispenser.n But this is easier to use and install than running a new water line and maybe a drain. If you invest in a jug style dispense look into a service for delivering the jug of water. n This is also a nice to have if you have water quality issues that can't be solved with a filter.nRead Less Nice product This water dispenser is very nice. It does a great job of both cooling and heating the water per your desire. It took me a little time to figure out how to get the hot water to dispense (you have to push the red button before you push the lever) as the instructions did not cover this. (If you try to first push the lever you cannot then push the red button.) My wife does not like the large, bright red and blue levers but those do not bother me. I like the fact that there are two power buttons on the rear, one for cold and one for hot. Hence, if you are using the dispenser primarily for cold water (and perhaps occasionally for hot), you can save on electricity by not keeping any of the water warmed by turning off the hot button. I did notice, however, that you can actually dispense hot water by using only one hand. You can do this by pushing the red button and pushing your cup against the red lever. Other dispensers I have used make it a bit more difficult to turn on the hot water, or, at least requiring two hands to do so. On the other hand, other dispensers I have used are not readily obvious how to simply dispense cold water. I think the large, brightly colored levers make this dispenser a good choice for households with children as it is very obvious which side to use for cold water. I would recommend, however, turning off the hot water power button in the back in such environments as the kids may figure out how to turn on the hot water and it can get pretty hot. In my household, we have found we use the cold water a lot more than the hot. We occasionally use the hot water for things like cocoa and tea.nRead Less Best Idea Ever OMG. I have always wanted one of these but never had the room for one. Now that I have room, I jumped on this. Being in a wheelchair, its a pain to keep going to the kitchen just for a glass of water or to make a cup of tea. I put this in my TV room so now I can do both without going anywhere. It is soooo simple to set up. Just put a bottle of water in it and plug in. Self explanatory to use. Red spigot for hot, blue for cold. Even my mother with Alzheimer's can use it. AS a matter of fact, this unit would probably be of use to many people disabled in a variety of ways. Spigot is easy to reach and simple to keep clean and its portable in case I need to move it to another room. I should of gotten one of these a lot sooner. I love it.nRead Less awesome The Avalon top loading water dispenser is a great looking hot and cold water dispenser. I love using the paddle spouts to dispense water rather than push buttons. The dispenser uses 3 gallon or 5 gallon water bottles. The cooler has a very slim design and fits my room very well. I like the highly efficient compressor it uses. very quiet. It also has a child safety lock on the hot water faucet.n Wow amazing water cooler I'm very impressed with this water cooler. Finally a nice sleek looking water cooler that also works wonderfully. I can either dispense ice cold water or steaming hot water. No need for ice when drinking water from here. The hot water is perfect for instant soups and coffee or tea. The build is really strong unlike some cheap plastics ones this actually has metal components. Definitely worth the purchase.n Just arrived, but so far so good. Water flow is excellent. Just arrived, but so far so good. Water flow is excellent. With young grandchildren around, I am pleased that I can completely turn off the hot water function.n Great Water Dispenser - Great Features & Value We have had different brands before, but this one is the best ever. I really like the flow rate - it actually has a decent flow rate instead of a dribble. The tray is big enough to set a cup on it and it has enough depth so that you can fill a tall glass without angling it. The hot is hot enough & the cold is cold enough. It does not have storage underneath, but I never really used that anyway. It is taller than most of the others. The child resistant hot is easy to use - just press the button first and then use the cup to push the lever....some of the other brands have hot water configurations that are difficult to use, but this one does not.n It is sturdy, easy to use Does what a water cooler should do. Bought it for the office and am completely content with it. It is sturdy, easy to use, and dispenses hot and cold water. Not much assembly to be done either. It is more compact than I had expected it to be, especially given how well it was packaged. It arrived very quickly via Prime and was triple boxed. Would buy again.n Absolutely great water cooler Absolutely great water coolern great cooler. is small enough to be discrete, but sleek enough to stand out. great cooler. is small enough to be discrete, but sleek enough to stand out.n Highly recommend this product.

I figured the first one I got might be a lemon but 2 in a row? Seems like faulty equipment. I use water dispensed from primo.n When my old rental cold water dispenser wore out after 25 plus years, I was given a replacement b... When my old rental cold water dispenser wore out after 25 plus years, I was given a replacement by my water supplier, but that cheap unit got more and more noisy over a period of 3 days. So, I decided to buy this Glacier Bay dispenser. It has nice features, such as the hot water dispenser which only runs when you need hot water. The dispensing buttons are very nice. The bottom loading feature is convenient, unless it malfunctions, which it likely will, resulting in no access to water. n To cut to the chase, the problem with this unit is the compressor noise. Unlike a refrigerator compressor, this compressor has an irritating pitch which is very distracting. And, as to runs every three minutes, it is especially annoying. I think the problem my be that the compressor is small and weak in order to save energy. If I can't find a quiet dispenser, I will either use an upright unit unplugged, or simply drink tap water. It would be nice to save $650 a year.nRead Less Not what I expected ... Not what I expectedn The instructions were hard to follow and the door for...

Kind of. n While we like the look of the cooler, almost immediately after set up we found that the magnets that hold the front door on are weak, and the vibration of the motor cooling the water is causing it. The motor will turn on, vibrate enough to disconnect the magnets; once this happens, the cooler stops cooling and heating the water. We're finding that we have to push the door closed several times a day, and the water is no longer cooled to our desired temp. Willing to amend the review if Glacier Bay (owned by Home Depot, from what I understand) is willing to offer a working replacement or a reasonable solution.n I believe the negative reviews may have been from people not allowing unit minimum of 12 hours in... I believe the negative reviews may have been from people not allowing unit minimum of 12 hours in upright position prior to plugging in. Cleaning instructions are vague.

Heats up great and quickly for a cup of tea or whatever, then automatically turns off. I do wish the screw to turn down or turn off the cold water was as easy though. The screw is set on the energy saving setting and it wont budge with a screwdriver. I never use cold water as room temp water is better for health. So its wasting some energy I dont need.

When I pick it up from the store the box was layered in dust and dirt. The service rep and I had to actually wipe down the entire box before I could leave the store with it. Once I arrived home the issues got worst.n The top of the unit was scuffed and scratch. The electric cord was stuffed inside of the mental grate on the back of the unit. This clearly showed that the unit was previously purchased and returned. Also, the hinges on the door where the water bottle is to be placed were broken. This means once you place the bottle inside of the dispenser, the door will not stay close.nRead Less This machine works good, we have only been using this for about a week now and seems to work grea...

I have used this exact model for a full year and it was a great purchase! The negative reviews worried me; so I got the extended warranty, but never needed it. For all the people who found problems and all the people interested in this model; I have some advice. I went to a store that had 3 or 4 of these, in stock. Then I picked the box with zero exterior damage. I brought the cooler home and I stood it up where I wanted it, in my kitchen. Then, AS STATED in the directions, I waited a full 24 hours before I plugged it in. This is necessary for any refrigerated appliance. It allows for the Freon, in liquid state, to settle back down after transport. If you use the button on the left you get room temperature water. If you use the button on the right, you get COLD water. There is an adjustment, on the back, to set the water to the coldness that you want. For HOT water, you first push the small round button and wait a short time for the water to heat up. It only takes a short time and it saves energy compared to my old GE cooler which heated the water 24/7. I use this for Ramen noodles and tea. It's only slightly longer to heat water than my Kurig and there is a lot more HOT water available. I am very happy with this purchase and I would recommend it to anyone. Just follow the set-up directions and your shouldn't have any problems.nRead Less 3 years without a problem I've had the cooler for over 3 years and have had no problems.n Runs very quite.

You can't put a bottle of water in this thing without spilling water every where! Also, the nozzles are so close to the wall of the dispenser, that you can't fill a coffee pot or a small bottle without getting water every where! I must bend over completely and hold my 5 cup coffee pot sideways just to fill it. My blind son can't even use the darn thing for hot water in his cup of soup because it takes TWO hands to dispense hot water. Not too easy for a blind person. Believe me, you have to be very limber and talented to get water out of this thing. I would have loved to return it, but I ruined the box opening it. I never dreamed that a water dispenser would be this hard to operate! My last one was wonderful and it lasted twenty years.

I went to Home Depot to get this \"dispenser\", It just worked fine for a few months. Now, there is not cold water. Wow!! this is junk!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! what a waste of money.

I received this water cooler a couple of days ago, several days earlier than originally indicated. I had been researching self cleaning bottom loading water coolers for about a month. Most of the popular units had good reviews but many of the owners had trouble with leaking. That was my major concern. While there were some reviews indicating leaking problems with this unit, the customer service experiences seemed pretty good. So I decided to take my chances with this one. It's more expensive than some of the others but I'm willing to pay a little more for additional peace of mind. So far there are no issues. The instructions leave something to be desired; I got on youtube to watch a couple of videos before I started it up. I checked the few connections that I could see in the bottle compartment and found nothing loose. The motor or pump that you can see seems to be attached very flimsily but I wiggled it a bit and it didn't come off. Everything works well; the cold water is cold and the hot is hot. I am not using the hot water frequently so I leave the heater off. The unit does make some noise when it is cooling; more of a hum/vibration noise. Probably about the same volume as a refrigerator. The room temperature water is cool and probably good enough if you didn't want to hear the humming. The nightlight is dim but probably good enough to dispense some water in the middle of the night. Since it's only been a few days I can't comment on potential future issues. So far so good; hopefully it will continue to work well with no leaks.nRead Less Nice product design, really like the room temp option in add Nice product design, really like the room temp option in addition to cooled & hot water.n lOVE THE WATER COOLER!!! lOVE THE WATER COOLER!!!n Very pleased with finish as it matches our appliances as it is near our kitchen and others looked...

The Avalon Bottom loading water cooler dispenser is very convenient and ideal. No needing to lift a 5 gallon bottle to the top nor having an eye sore of it. You just simply open the stainless steel cabinet door and load the 3 or 5 gallon bottle into the bottom loading station while applying the probe hanger into the bottle. You have the choice to dispense hot, room temperature and cold water with a push button. The drip tray is easy to remove to clear out any excess drips or spills. The hot water dispenser is wonderful for hot tea/coffee, soup. I feel safe with the child safety lock push button. Once you have followed the user manual you will enjoy this wonderful water dispenser. I feel so much as ease knowing it's safer to load the bottle into the bottom loading water cooler dispenser versus our old top load water dispenser. This dispenser also has an LED night light switch and is rather bright. I really like the flashing red light to alert you when the bottle is empty. Super happy with the smooth black/stainless steel body. The 5 gallon water bottle is out of site. My family and I are really happy wtih the water cooler dispenser.nRead Less This thing is awesome.

I had always wanted one, but my wife never wanted a large bulky looking thing with a water bottle sitting on top of it in the kitchen. Also she couldn't manage lifting a 5 gallon jug of water and turning it upside down. Avalon has the solution for all of this. The unit is black with a stainless steel bottom cabinet which looks great. The water jug is hidden in the bottom of the cabinet, so not only is it out of sight, but you do not have to lift anything. The size of the unit is 40\" high, 13\" in depth and only 12\" wide. It is not heavy and has a nice fold down handle on the back , if you would like to move it to other locations (I would remove the jug of water in the bottom first, lol) The convenience of having hot, room temp. or cold water as options in one station is something I have not seen before. This cooler is truely an upgrade! The set-up is easy. It has a long extenion cord and the controls are on the upper back and top of the unit. It also has a built in night light, which is such a nice added feature! Just read the user manual carefully, follow instructions, and enjoy!nRead Less Compact and easy to use.

For those wondering budget wise, Water bottles (at least around here) are around 12$ each, refils are around 6$. So the upkeep isn't bad. Sure changing bottles takes some muscle, but it's easier then running new plumbing right? n So, the dispenser itself. It is a very nice finish. Matches great with modern stainless steel appliances. Great for any household application where you don't have clean/filtered water and want some. It doesn't look like a cheap watercooler, it actually fits subtly among the rest of the kitchen. n This is also great for anyone that has say a basement or upstairs where they might want a fresh drink more handy than going all the way to the kitchen and back.nRead Less A great bottom load water dispenser that takes up less room due to its sleekness and the fact th... Compact and easy to use. Bottom loading dispensers eliminate the hassle of lifting and flipping over a 3 or 5 gallon bottle onto the top. This unit has a probe that reaches all the way down to the bottom of the bottle to use as much water as possible and attaches securely without tipping or spilling. Setup out of the box is quick but if you want to do the additional recommended cleaning before first use you will need to disassemble the top and internal container to add water directly to it and drain out the back.n This unit allows dispensing of room temperature, chilled, and hot water all from the same bottle. The pump and heating/cooling elements make a little noise but nothing distracting. There is also switch for a night light that illuminates the front surface over the drip basin. The basin itself also has a red float that will pop up when it needs to be emptied. There are also indicator lights when water is actively cooling or heating that turn off when it's ready.n All in all a relatively simple but very useful product.nRead Less This water cooler is very nice.

A great bottom load water dispenser that takes up less room due to its sleekness and the fact that there's no bottle on the top to look at. It gives 3 different temperatures of water and has switches in the back where you can turn off the hot or cold if you choose too. There's also a night light which is something iv`e never seen before now. Very easy to set this up and insert the straw into the water bottle then push the bottle into the bottom unit then close the floor -done! Takes 15 minutes to initially warm up the hot water & 45 minutes for the cold to get chilled. Another thing i really like about this unit besides the optional night light is that the water stream is strong so you get your water faster. Lighter unit to move around & a excellent value as well.I would recommend buying his water dispenser by AvalonnRead Less I plan to install this \"cooler\" in a covered Gazebo near our pool so both kids and adults need n... This water cooler is very nice. I have used the top loaders before and it's always kind fun getting the bottle on the cooler without spilling water everywhere. This one lets you slide in the bottle from the bottom without the hassle. My wife can't do the gravity fed water cooler, but this one is no problem. I first cleaned the unit like the directions said to, then hooked up my first bottle of water. At first I didn't realize that I had to turn the cooler/heater on. Once I realized that, I turned the heating/cooling on and had nice cold/hot water in no time. This unit uses a pump, so unlike the top loaders that use gravity to dispense, you're relying on a pump that pulls water up into the unit and into a small tank. The tank heats or cools the water, then dispenses. I am very happy overall. The unit looks nice and does what it should. I recently moved into a home with well water and even though the well checked out ok, I'd still rather have the bottled water on hand.nRead Less I have been very pleased with the cooler. I plan to install this \"cooler\" in a covered Gazebo near our pool so both kids and adults need not run into the house for simply a drink of water.n The bottom loading, pump feature makes this cooler safer (not top-heavy), easier to load, and aesthetically more pleasing to look at.n The three temperature option was something I was not aware of as well as the safety lock on the hot-water switch.

Beautiful bottom loading water cooler dispenser, that is energy saving! Works fantastic, there are three switches on the back you can choose to turn on or off, the red one for hot water, one for cold water and the other is to turn night light on or off. There is also a handle on the back of this unit to aid in help moving it. On the top of the machine are three button one for hot water, room temperature water and cold water. Very easy set up, it only took about 45 minutes to get cold water after plugging it in the first time. Very easy to dispense hot, room temp and cold water at the touch of a button. It is very stylish, and takes up very little space. I really like the door on the front of the machine where the water bottle is, all you have to do is swing it open to change the bottle. Very, very nice machine.nRead Less n/a I am remodeling my basement into different rooms and one being a kitchen area and so I was looking for a new water cooler for my home. I found this water cooler and I love it. I want to say that I first love the shape of it. I then love that it is stainless steel.

I was going to buy the standard top load water cooler for $98 when I spotted this one saying it was a bottom load. I splurged and bought the bottom load. Not having to muscle a 50-pound jug of water onto a top load cooler was worth the extra money.The dispensing buttons are much better than some of the old types where the handles break off.n Water temperature control is set to about 40F. Hot water works ok also.n The only negative is the long run times when in the cooling mode.When the unit turns on to cool the water it seems to run forever. It runs about 45 minutes or more when it cycles on. n It is not too noisy but it is noticeable. We notice it as it sits within 5 or 6 feet from our easy chairs. n We talked with the technical people about the long run times and they said it was normal and had no answer and said take it back if you are not happy with it. Of course that is always a hassle also.n It seems this unit has a very small compressor for cooling as it is rated at only 75 watts when in cooling mode. This is about one tenth of a horse power compressor, which is very small. Most good sized refrigerators use about one third horse power compressors which would be about 7 times larger than the one in this cooler. It would be nice if they upgraded the compressor to shorten run times and the noise associated with them.nRead Less Nice looking cooler but it didn't even last 1 year.

The yellow flashing light lets me know when the water bottle is empty. The only improvements I can think of are a stronger pump for the flow of water and a clearer description of how the pump and cap are supposed to sit loosely on top of the water bottle.n Great!!!! Great!!!!n Great Water Dispenser! We purchased this about 2 weeks ago. We had a top loading cooler for years. It is great not to see that big water bottle on top. I can now load the bottle myself. Could never pick up the bottle on our old one. The water comes out cold and the flow comes out pretty fast. The hot water takes about 3 minutes to watm up but when finished it is very hot. There is a light that lets you know when the bottle is empty. There is a blue light that reads \"Glacier Bay and the blue light that stays on when the water is finished cooling. At night these lights light up the whole room. I like my house completely dark at night so this is a little annoying. Other than than I am completely satisfied.n Solid Purchase I went from a top loading dispenser to a bottom loading dispenser and it works very well and is very easy to use. This dispenser is great but I wasn't expecting the hot water to be delayed. You need to press a button for the water to be heated and it will be ready after a few minutes of heating.n Best purchase ever made on this type of product. Comparing this to my last dispenser....there is no comparison! I don't have to lift the 5 gal. water bottles (big plus) and they are easy to install. The water comes out at a fair rate with better quality. the cold water is icy cold, then there is room temp. and the hot is piping hot. Its not hot immediately, you have to hit a button and let it heat up for 3 min., which I figure is better as it saves on electricity by not having to keep it hot all day. The buttons are on top so you don't have to bend over to fill a cup (another plus) and the light provides a night light for my kitchen and directs you on where to lay your cup. Also, the price is reasonable.It's all good!n Good Idea - Poor Execution I'm not at all dissatisfied with the operation and ease of use. I'm extremely disappointed with the lack of quality and excessive noise of the unit. Aquarium pumps are inexpensive and much quieter that the water pump on this unit. I'm sure the mounting hardware for the water pump is light gauge metal because the unit vibrates more than it should when the pump is running. Also the compressor \"clangs\" when it stops. It's just another example of building cheap rather than building quality. If you purchase one, don't put it where noise will bother you.n Very nice water dispenser I rate this product 4 stars (good) for 2 reasons: 1. The instructions are pictorial with no text making it difficult to understand. Normally you would think a picture is worth a thousand words, but not so in this case. The layout of the instructions is also confusing; 2. It is very difficult to clean initially. Apparently there is a cleaning solution (which is not included)that can be purchased that probably would make it easier. It took 2 bottles (bottle water) to rid the hose taste from the water. Be sure to let the unit stand for at least 12 hours unplugged so the agitated (from shipping) refrigerant and oil can get to their respective places before start up. All in all I'm very satisfied with the dispenser and would recommend it.nRead Less Great Purchase Packaged very well not even a scratch. Set up was a simple task. Performance is excellent, we have gone through a 5 gal. bottle and replacement of the bottle was real easy. We really like the cooler.n Dead Out of the Box Ordered online, received yesterday. Per the instructions let it sit 12 hours before plugging it in. Imagine my surprise, and frustration, when it failed to suck up the cleaning solution. The pump ran but did not suck up a drop. Re-read the instructions, double checked everything. Tried again, still nothing. The pump runs for 20 seconds but fails to suck the cleaning solution up into the unit. Decided to try it on a 5 gal. water bottle. Nope, nothing! It ain't happening. Read the troubleshooting guide. \"Possible air pocket - Push down on the dispenser buttons to prime the unit\". Still no avail and not a hint of anything else to try.n At the bottom of the cover page of the instruction booklet is an invitation to \"visit us online to see our full line of products\" but there is no web-address. A Google search for \"Glacier Bay\" brings up Glacier Bay National Park, and Glacier Bay Bathroom and Kitchen Products at Home Depot but no web-address for Glacier Bay. Does Glacier Bay even exist? Or is that a name for products manufactured by a Chinese factory for Home Depot?n I can't wait to talk to the Glacier Bay customer service people today!nRead Less Did not last very long. Bought it at Home Depot. Very loud daily operation and when filling the cold water tank. Nice water temperature, but again very noisy. Today went to use it and there is some kind of liquid (not water) under the water bottle. Had it less than 2 years.n Glacier Bay Water Dispensor The water dispenser was well designed and easy to use.n No Flip, no spill..... I have been used to the old style, flip the bottle over, water coolers, and while they work great, lifting the bottle is a chore. This Glacier Bay model is perfect. The bottle slides in, underneath and the water is pumped up. It works great. It has hot, cold and room temp water. The hot water will take a min or two to heat up and has a child lock. This method is much better than having the water hot all the time as it saves on energy. This is a great addition to our kitchen, seeing that we don't have a water dispenser in our fridge. Overall it is recommended.n Best Purchase Ever... so nice to have it so so nice to have it nice to keep cleann very nice product I received my dispenser after a little longer wait than expected but it's OK I was happy to have it. the prior one only had two different water setting cold and room temperature. Now I can put away my warming carafe and just be done with it. Also it is nice not to have to pick up those heave water bottles just sort of roll them into place and this cooler match my appliances.n So Much Easier Than A Top Load Bottle Model I needed to get this Bottom Load Water Dispenser because of a shoulder injury. I wasn't able to use my top load bottle dispenser because I could lift and flip the 5 gallon bottle. Why didn't I do this sooner? I love this bottom load water dispenser. It is so simple to use and no strain or stress on my body and no water mess to clean up from the inevitable spills when flipping the bottle over. Super easy to use. I like that the straw for pumping the water from the bottle into the dispenser is made of stainless steel and not plastic. It is IMPORTANT to clean the water dispenser prior to using and approximately every 4 months as noted in the instructions. I add 10 drops of grapefruit seed extract to every bottle of water for additional antibacterial protection. Unit heats hot water in under 3 minutes from point of turning it on. Cold water adjustment is on the back and easy to adjust to your desired temperature. There is a built in safety feature to shut off the heating element when the water bottle is low on water. There is also a child safety button to prevent children from accidentally dispensing hot water. Nice LED control panel. I highly recommend this bottom load water dispenser to make life simpler! And it looks great with black and stainless steel!nRead Less No lift and Flip What I like about this water cooler the best is that I don't have to lift and flip the 5 gallon bottle and on my previous cooler when water bottle dropped on the pin it always feels like the thing is about to break with a big clunk.n The pump is a bit loud, however not lifting and flipping over comes this very slight annoyance.n What I would like to see changed is the hot water always be available, the way this one works is you push the button and wait for it to heat up. I'd like to have hot water on demand. However this is a nice energy saving feature.n Also, the lighted display could be used for something more useful then the brand name. For example, reminder to clean the system.n Overall, much nicer then my old style gravity feed.nRead Less Easy bottle replacement I received the water dispenser today, it is fairly heavy approximately forty pounds. The directions stated that if the unit was not in the upright position when it was delivered (which mine was not it came UPS)it must be left in the upright position for approximately twelve hours before turning on.After the letting it sit for twelve hours it was very easy to install the 5 gallon bottle of water in it the bottom door is magnetically attached and comes completely off,In a few hours I had nice cold water. I then tried the hot water it takes a couple of minutes to heat up (power saver feature) then worked great.n Beautiful, easy to use, no more bottles to waste and energy efficient, perfect Got it shipped fast, well packaged, easy to take out, very light to handle. Once unpack-aged it looks great, no fingerprints on the stainless steel. We really like the feature that it gives you not only cold or hot water, it also gives you room temperature water so no more mixing the water to get the room temp. Another great feature is that it can hold 3 gallon bottles as well, since the 5 and 4 are kind of heavy for my family to carry. In the back there is an adjustment for the temp of the water so it comes complete. We do not like to waste a bunch of bottles so this is the best solution and the dispenser looks great. Overall great qualityn No more flipping bottles. I've had several other top load water coolers and this one is 100% better. Very reasonable for the price and the features are all there. Low water indicator, and indicators for both the hot and cold temperatures. I like that it will not constantly heat water all the time, and allows you to press a button to heat the water, and then if not used for a while, will stop heating water. It only took a minute to heat back up, so about as long as I would wait for a microwave. I do wish it had a setting for how long to keep heating before it stops, but this feature saves electric and water from evaporation. The cold water cycles too, so this unit seems to be very thrifty on energy. It even has a room temperature water option if you don't need hot or cold water. The bottle feed tube is adjustable for different size bottles, but the cap does not actually clamp to the top of my brand of bottle, it just sits on the top, which is fine as it will not shift easily. The door is held on with magnets, so you don't need to worry about hinges opening the access door a specific direction and needing additional clearance, and inside the doorway is a door sensor to shut down the system when the door is open. I will say that I hate Glacier Bay manuals. I like to read my directions and these are all pictures that are not always easy to interpret. The manual must also be supplemented with a couple placards as the manual does not discuss how to adjust the tube length at all.nRead Less Beautiful new kitchen item This deluxe full-size stainless steel water cooler dispenses hot, cold and room temperature water. Features fingerprint resistant stainless steel cabinet, and easy to use push buttons controls, LED nightlight and ready to dispense indicator lights. This unit complements the decor of most kitchens with other stainless steel amenities. The on-demand energy saving feature rapidly provides steaming hot water without the cost of constantly re-heating water. This is great for making hot soups and/or hot beverages. Another nice feature is the easy to use push buttons with a childproof safety lock for hot water. Uses either 3 or 5 Gal. bottles of water, bottom loading, so no more heavy lifting for me.nRead Less Best purchase ever!!!! We put this in our fifth wheel, no more carrying gallons of water, every weekend. we only have to purchase two 5 gallons jugs, and they last a long time (our well water up north has a rotten egg smell). This bottom load water dispenser it makes life so much easier, you remove the magnetic door on the front, it very easily comes off (no hinges to break) and insert the drinking straw and slide the water bottle into place. It is as easy as that. I love having not to try and lift a water bottle on the top. We love this unit. It has hot water with child proof button, room temperature water and cold water. We actually refill our 23.7 ounce water bottles (fits under the spout with room to spare) to save on plastic going into our landfills! Going to purchase another one for home!!nRead Less The Best OOOH Boy!!! The best dispenser ever because I no longer have to aim the bottle in the little hole and I no longer need to clean water splash. This dispenser is very easy to use, simply open the bottom door, slide the bottle, insert the pump line and enjoy the cold water. The water temperature can be controlled from the back of the cooler. Its very quiet with minimal noise when the pump draws the water. The pump comes on for a few seconds. Overall, excellent.n junk got it home directions said if you laid it on its side don't use it for 12 hrs so next day I installed the water bottle and pluged it in when my wife got home she used it and the water would not stop coming out so I dragged it to the door and threw it in the driveway it was junkn 3rd time's a charm I ordered this as a replacement to a top loading cooler we have been using for quite some time. I really liked the idea of having the actual water jug hidden, giving a clean look. The first unit I received was defective, it had a leak somewhere near the compressor. Working with Home Depot and the supplier I was sent another unit which was damaged during delivery. Again the supplier was quick to replace it. I now have a working unit. I can only imagine the first unit I received was an exception to the rule, and the second unit was no fault of the supplier and they quickly resolved the issue. Now that I have had a chance to use this I have to say I really like it. The look of a bottom loading unit is so much nicer then a top loader. I turned up the chill adjustment because it just wasn't quite cold enough from the factory for my liking. I now get cold water at 38.5 degrees, perfect! I wasn't sure if I would like the kettle feature for hot water but it has turned out to not be an issue. When I want hot water I press the button and about 2 mins later it dispenses water at around 171 degrees. Great for my morning tea. I can hear it running when it is cooling the water or pumping water from the jug but nothing that is distracting. Even though I have had some issues I would still recommend this for anyone wanting a nice water cooler.nRead Less Great product Great water dispenser. Bottom load makes it easy to change the bottle when empty. I also love the hot water dispenser when I want a cup of tea. Just a few minutes and it's ready. Three levels of water temperature is a nice feature too. Another reason I picked this particular dispenser out is it matches my black and stainless steel appliances. Grandchildren love the cold water after playing hard outside.n Working great so far! Working great so far!n Great Product. Quiet and delivers very cold water. Great Product.

This is your standard bottle fed (2.5 or 5 gallon bottle) water cooler with all the perks.Convenient size unit to accommodate ease of use dispensing action and dispenses piping hot water or nice cold fresh water... even just room temperature.

The top loading hot and cold water dispenser is fully assembled and requires nothing more than unpacking it and plugging it in. It accommodates the regular 5 gallon water jugs.In my test (see video) the dispenser flow is about 1 oz per second (it takes around 12 seconds to dispense 12 oz of chilled water).The hot water dispensing lever has a safety feature that requires you also depress a button on the lever, which helps prevent accidental scolds.The heating and cooling elements are very quiet and proved to be inaudible in our hospital environment.n Looks and works great!!!

I needed a water cooler and decided to obtain the Avalon Top Loading Hot and Cold Water Dispenser. It has a very small footprint, which is perfect for my small kitchen. I had it installed and ready to go in just a few minutes. The heating element produces piping hot water, perfect for instant coffee, soups and hot cocoa. The compressor also produces very cold water, and has no noticeable motor noise. The hot water paddle includes a child safety lock.n I really like the separate on/off switches for coid and hot water, which saves energy when not in use. The build quality is very good and the water dispenser is competitively priced. Highly Recommended!!n And yet another great product offered by Home depot.

This Avalon hot/cold water dispenser is a great addition to our kitchen as the water in our area is a little bit hard. easy top loading with a slim design make it easy to fit in most places. Hot water has a safety lock on it to help not get dispensed on accident. Easy to use paddle knobs. I really love it for the winter months to make hot chocolate. Also you can use a three gallo bottle as well. Looks real nice and it is very easy to use.n The Avalon water dispenser is great for hot and cold water dispensing. My old water cooler final... The Avalon water dispenser is great for hot and cold water dispensing. My old water cooler finally quit after 15 years. I was hoping to find a new dispenser that was as reliable, but quieter. The Avalon is very quiet, and provides very cold and hot water and uses much less energy than my old water cooler. Dispensing buttons are very easy to use and there is a child safety button feature on the hot. Water dispensing handles are large and have a linear water flow. I love the fact the hot water comes out hot enough for my tea that I don't need to warm up the water in the microwave anymore. The foot print of the unit is slightly smaller than my old one and is very attractive in look and design. The 5 gallon water bottle sits and seals nicely on top. My only wish is the power plug was a 90 degree style to minimize space required in front of a power outlet. Overall, I'm very pleased with this new Avalon water dispenser.nRead Less RE: Avalon ~ Top Loading, Hot and Cold, Water Cooler Dispenser A great cooler for home or office...

I currently have mine set up in my home kitchen.n It's ready to operate straight out the box. Unpack, place in a convenient location, install water bottle, plug in and turn on switches.

Simply unpack, move to a location with an outlet, plug it in, turn on the hot and or cold switches, load up the water jug and enjoy. The cooling unit can take about 90 minutes to completely cool, but the hot water is ready to use within 15 minutes of plugging the unit in. The only complaint I have is that the unit seems to lean forward. The unit has a set of rear and front feet, but I haven't found a way to adjust them. I used a piece of scrap board to put under the front feet to solve this issue.n This unit is nice in tech and design. It is a bit bland in design, to plain and tall. It is too ... This unit is nice in tech and design. It is a bit bland in design, to plain and tall. It is too bad that it does not have storage below, what a waste of space. I did not see a hard water line hook-up for a possible water filter add on or direct water line. The controls are good but the hot water child safety still puts your finger exposed to the hot water coming out. The on/off options for the different water temps is a great option.. I would like it to look a bit more stylish and not so straight lined and flush. Fix the hot water child button to you don't get burnt, put storage below and we have a winner.n This product was easy to set up This product was easy to set up. It remains to be seen how long this product functions but I feel we are off to a good start. The child proof button on the hot water is an excellent feature. After cleaning the dispenser to set it up, everything ran very well. I did have to call the 800 number but it turned out I had the wrong instruction manual. Tech support was excellent with their help and suggestions. The correct manual was emailed me instantly. At this point: I couldn't be happier.n Good but slow water flow Water is SLOW coming out and it does get cold but not as cold as the tall ones.

The bottom loading is awesome! The product didn't come with the necessary cleaning fluid...whatever that is...So if you're new to bottled water dispensers, like me, and don't know it has to be cleaned a certain way BEFORE USE, the water will taste HORRIBLE!! If you're like my fiancé, and have no taste buds, you'll never notice. But then like me you'll wonder how sick it's going to make you if you keep drinking it without cleaning it first, and you'll miss out on the first fresh cold five gallons of water!!The hot water, unlike the older style ones I'm used to using, has to be pre-heated before dispensing so you have to push a button to heat the water. I for one am too impatient for that. If I have to do that, I just as well use the same tea kettle Ive been using for four years to heat water for about a tenth of the price. The instructions don't tell you what kind of cleaning solution you need to buy so that's another downfall. I don't have any idea what to look for. Nor do I have the desire to spend two hours in the store looking for it. Not to mention the hours (or in my case days) that it takes for the cleaning cycle to complete. So overall, not real thrilled with the entire process. I'm sure there has to be an faster/easier to use product on the market for around the same price.nRead Less Got it undamaged, plug it in, and has been working...

So now I'm stuck with this unit that I can't return. Thanks for wasting $200+ of my paycheck, and I'm still stuck renting a top loader now.n Soooo noisy Works great. Pump is very loud. I live in a 1400 sq ft. One floor home and this pump is extremely noisy. Not only is the pump loud but when it cools the water it \"clicks\". It's like electric base board heaters heating up. All I hear when watching TV is click, click, click, click. I only used the hot water once because it takes 3 min to heat up after hitting the button. Why not just microwave the needed water? It will be hot in 2 minutes from the micro. I would not purchase this model. Look for something without a pump and a quite cooling mechanism.n Love it.

I was renting a different make/model from a water delivery service and they raised the rent, so I decided to buy one. I am disappointed with this item. Cons:* Biggest complaint: I need to press the power button to get hot water. The other cheaper model has instant hot water. After pushing the button, I have to wait around for the water to heat up. *2nd complaint: This thing makes a lot of noise compared to the other one, all day/night long. Constant ticking noise and other annoying noises. Other noise: when the pump has to pump up the water from below to the reservoir. Mind you, this device doesn't have full time hot water either, so all this noise is due to the cold water. Yes, I have turned up (raised) the cold water temp, but still does it. I can hear it 50 feet away, in the living room, and I don't have great hearing. *The water pours out slowly due to the fact that it has to \"pull\" up the water from below to the aforementioned reservoir. The gravity fed ones dispenses water quicker, due to that fact, I suppose. *Unnecessary blue lightsPros:*Looks nice: blue lights (still unnecessary), stainless, and nice black gloss finish*Three water temp options*Easier to load bottlen I will be returning this tomorrownRead Less Fairly easy to set up.

The Avalon water cooler is a great addition to our kitchen. The cold water is the perfect temperature , not too cold nor too warm. It's refreshingly cold! The hot water is on demand and is very hot! It's perfect for oatmeal and tea. If you have small children you can control the cold and hot water outputs via switches on the back of the cooler. There is a child safety mechanism on the hot water dispenser. You can also turn off cold and hot if you want room temperature water. The cooler holds three or five gallon round containers, but also accommodates the rectangle type, although a tight fit. Water refills are expensive, so be prepared. New water with bottle is $13.99 and refills are $6.99, most places. Five gallons of bottled water costs about $2.49. Luckily, we have a self-fill water station at the beverage store for $1.00 per five gallons. We love the fact that the bottle is hidden underneath. That makes it easier to load and is more pleasing in appearance.nRead Less Much easier then the top loaders. I've owned 4 other top loaders and I have to say I like this on... Much easier then the top loaders. I've owned 4 other top loaders and I have to say I like this one the best. No more struggling to lift 5 gallons of water. And there is no way to drop or spill any water. Its a little pricey but quality and ease of use always cost more. The hot water heats up real quick and is hot enough for tea. The cold isn't super cold but plenty cold enough for a cool glass of water. But due to the very hot water they have added a child safety lock. You can put either 5 or 3 gallon containers in this unit. It is also self cleaning which is a great feature for keeping the water safe to drink. It also has an empty bottle light that goes on when the bottle is empty.n Really great features on this new Avalon 3- Temperature Self Cleaning Stainless Steel Bottom Load... Really great features on this new Avalon 3- Temperature Self Cleaning Stainless Steel Bottom Loading Water Cooler. Very easy to understand directions included in User Manual. Only takes one hour for the unit to be able to produce really cold, crisp water, and about 20 minutes for super hot water. Love that it is also self cleaning and uses an ozone system for this procedure. Energy Star feature is also an added plus, in my opinion. Bottom loading for either a 5 gallon, or a 3 gallon jug. I am delighted with the hot water feature for my evening tea, or hot apple cider, and also that it has child-proof features built in. Overall, a very well built quality unit. No corners were cut in the production of this water cooler. Great job AVALON, and also Home Depot for providing durable, quality equipment I look forward to many years of continued use. I also like the carrying handle on the center back, that was not mentioned in the Users Manual.nRead Less This water cooler is easy to use and has several nice features. First and foremost, it is a bott... This water cooler is easy to use and has several nice features. First and foremost, it is a bottom loading cooler. It is ascetically pleasing since you don't see a big ole jug of water mounted on top of it. That also eliminates having to lift up 40+ pounds and then position it correctly without wrenching your back, or spilling water all around. For this cooler, all you need to do is take the cap off of the water bottle, insert the probe into the bottle, and slide the water bottle into bottom of the cooler. n One of the nice features for this process is the probe hanger mounted on the inside of the door. You can hang the probe on there and not worry about the probe picking up dirt or debris off of the floor. n This cooler can cool the water, heat the water, do one or the other, or do neither. The heated water came out of ours around 150 degrees. The cold water comes out around 45 degrees or so. The heated water spout also has a safety button. The button must be pressed in along with the lever itself for the hot water to be dispensed. n Another feature this water cooler has is an ozone cleaning system. You simply press/hold for 5 seconds the ozone button on the back and the water tank is theoretically cleaned. The only way to tell anything is happening at this point is by the blinking blue light on the front, and also the occasional gurgling noise from the machine. Did I notice any difference afterwards? No, but my machine is barely 2 weeks old. n Another great feature is the night light. An on/off switch in the back turns on an led light behind the nozzles. It's enough light to illuminate the area around the cooler for easy access in the dark. n This machine is made in China.nRead Less Love this Water Cooler This Avalon Self Cleaning, Hot and Cold, Bottom Loading Water Cooler is the best water dispenser I have owned. I have well water here and have a reverse osmosis system fr the house but still do not trust the water for drinking. I purchase Spring Water for drinking and preparing meals. I love that this water cooler has child safety features, self-cleaning functions, safety features for preventing overheating, has a slim design that can fit almost any were and loads the water from the bottom...no more lifting to the top of the dispenser.n Works great, easy to use. This is my second bottom loading (one upstairs and one downstairs) water dispenser and I totally love them! There is no more struggling to lift a 5 gallon bottle up and over to try and insert it into those top loading units without spilling a whole bunch of water. Just insert the provided probe into your 3 or 5 gallon bottle of water, click into place & slip the bottle into the unit. The machine does the work for you! The design is great and I do like the night light feature as well.n wow The AVALON self cleaning , hot and cold, bottom loading water cooler is very good water cooler. I think the cooler looks great in my kitchen. It has paddles to operate the hot and cold spigots, very simple to use. There are 3 temp. settings, hot, cold and room temp. It holds a 3 or 5 gal. water bottle. I like the LED nite light feature that can be turned off and on.n Super nice water cooler Probably the nicest looking water cooler I've owned. The stainless steel and front panel LED's make this water cooler look great as well as add a nice touch to your kitchen. This has a very clean, modern look to it and really just looks great overall. The three water temp settings are really great on this. My previous unit only had cold/hot but the additional room temp setting is nice. Probably my favorite feature of this water cooler is the instant hot water. Previous units I've owned, you had to wait a couple minutes for the water cooler to heat up the water before it dispenses it but not on this unit. This unit pumps out hot water instantly and it's quite nice. No more waiting for hot water to boil. n Temp wise, the water is fine. The cold is pretty good but the hot water is hot enough for instant coffee/tea but probably not for something like instant noodles. For most needs, the hot water should be adequate enough. n There are switches on the back of the unit that you'll need to turn on prior to using the cooler. Seems a bit odd to me but you only have to flip them on once. n The only negative things I can say about this cooler is;n 1. The access door for the water bottle is hinged on the left side. My previous water cooler, the door was unhinged and held in place by magnets. As such, I was able to squeeze the unit into a pretty narrow place and still be able to remove the water bottle without issue. Since the door is hinged on this one, I have to space it away from my cabinet a bit in order to be able to open the door. This isn't a huge issue I think but more of a convenience thing for me. n 2. The siphon on this water cooler is plastic. My other unit, the siphon was stainless steel and seemed a lot sturdier. This issue is more of a durability thing than anything else. I think the siphon should've been stainless steel but plastic is suitable as well I think. n Overall, the instant hot water on this water cooler really does it for me. It's so much more convenient with this feature than standing there for a couple minutes waiting for the water to heat on other units. The modern look of this water cooler is a plus as well. Really nice water cooler.nRead Less Avalon water cooler Arrived on timeEasy to set up Hot tab very hot, cold water is very cold.So far so good..

Although this is a countertop model, it measures 19 inches tall and most kitchens have only a space of 18 inches under the wall cabinet. The installation is simple, but you have to drill a hole on your countertop or find some other opening to run the hose up to the counter. I'm using it on a bar area where there are no upper cabinets so it works out. The dispenser is nice and the water tastes great, but I'm concerned about the filter being so expensive when it's time for replacement. The competitor model sells their filter for half as much. You need to sanitize every 3 months and should use the self cleaning feature weekly. The cycle lasts 90 minutes. It's a nice machine, I hope it lasts.nRead Less We absolutely love it.

We're still getting used to the controls, but both the cold and hot water features work well. It does not take up too much space and has added an additional level of convenience to our kitchen. So very glad we got this unit and very happy to recommend.n Avalon Bottle less water dispenser First to start it say that is counter-top water dispenser, it ... Avalon Bottle less water dispenserFirst to start it say that is counter-top water dispenser, it is pretty compact for all functionality that it contain.It does come with everything that you need to set it up and be ready for water dispensing, but I do have couple small problems, not with machine but with my kitchen cabinets. The cabinets are set to some standard 18u201d from the counter-top but this dispenser is about 19.5u201d tall which means it will not fit under the cabinets and that is the reason I'm giving 4 stars, another issue is water line, I have granite countertop in kitchen and to make hole in it I would have to have specialty tool, and Iu2019m afraid even to start (granite can easily crack)I went with different approach I got the shelf that is similar in base size and install it in dining area in the unusable corner and since I have basement under the area I run the water supply from the sink to the water dispenser and wola it worked.Now about water dispenser it really wort it you will have all different option for example if you are planning to use as a cooler than you do not need to turn the heater on or versa, and water taste great, no more chlorine taste and smell in my cup of water.It have activate Self-cleaning function and it suggested to be used every week, how does it work well it sanitize tanks and water lines and machine will produce ozone which will be injected in the water line and tanks. The cycle last 90 minutes and during this process manufacturer recommend not to use dispenser.Machine will cool water down to about 34 to 38 degree F and heat up to 185 degree F.The water filter should be replaced every 6 months or 1500 gallons.Overall I love it.

What I like about this machine is that the installation is very easy. The only issue was that the dispenser couldnu2019t be placed on my counter-top so I will be using a side table near the kitchen. I first disconnected the kitchen faucet hose from the water feed. I attached the T-connector (this is like a valve diverter/splitter) that came with the dispenser to the cold water feed. I reconnected the kitchen faucet line and the dispenser plastic pipe to the T-connector. I ran this plastic pipe under the dishwasher and the counter to reach the dispenser located near my pantry. I attached this water feed line to another valve near the dispenser filter. After completing all the connections, I open all the valves. I was glad that none of the connections were leaking. I turned on the dispenser.n The first water that came out was very cloudy and I believe that this is just air bubbles. After a few more use the water came out normal. I did the first taste test with cold water. Compare to the tap water, the dispenser greatly improvement my water. It greatly reduces the bad taste from the water. I did a ph test with ph test strips of both tap water and the filtered dispenser water. The ph of tap water was about 6.6 and the dispenser was 7.0 (see image). The cold water had a good temperature. The hot water dispenser has a child safety lock which was not difficult for an adult to use. Water came out very hot, good for use with hot teas or coffee. I was very surprised that the hot water reached 180-degree Fahrenheit (82-degrees Celsius). I ran to temperature test and I got the same result. n The dispenser has a very attractive design. With all the features, this makes it a wonderful water dispenser.nRead Less AVALON COUNTERTOP HOT/COLD WATER COOLER I just received my Avalon Countertop Hot/Cold Water Coole...

First off it is beautiful! It as compact as possible for what it performs and even though it claims some counter space it doesn't take up nearly as much space as full size water cooler. Second it is BOTTLELESS that means no running out to pick up water and all the hassle entailed. If you are concerned about the water quality I purchased the basic water purification system. Our city water is almost undrinkable from the bad taste and chlorine odor. This system delivers pure and amazing water. My kids are drinking a lot more water now. For me the third and best feature is the hot water function. For us this was a big purchase and one of the ways I rationalized this purchase was we needed a new coffee maker. We had a pod system but because of our poor water quality it only lasted a year (this is typical for coffee makers in our house) Dreading going back to the stove top which takes too long we purchased this water dispenser. I can't begin to describe the amazing feeling of just running water into your french press and having coffee in seconds. Now this leads me to really the best reason of all to buy this product. I had previously and hastily reviewed this product at only 2 stars. If i'm honest that wasn't fair but despite all of the great features of this product I was disappointed with the hot water.

It's a slow process but coming along since we are doing the work ourselves in our spare time. When I saw this item, I had to have it. It's great that refrigerators a lot of time have cold water in them, but now a days, it's really nice to also have hot water on demand for that cup of tea or for the kids to make their instant noodle soup. This is on our counter in our kitchen next to our refrigerator. This does have to have a dedicated water line running to it, so if you don't know how to do that on your own, you will have to hire somebody to hook it up for you. This wasn't an issue for us as we hadn't hooked up the water line to our refrigerator yet, so when we did that, we ran this one too and it's good to go. It has filters to take out the impurities in tap water so you get nice, fresh tasting water.nRead Less works great works great and easy to installn Works great!

A little louder than I expected, but so far so good, only been operating for 4 days thoughn This cooler is a lovely idea and a way to have instantaneous hot filtered water at your disposal.... This cooler is a lovely idea and a way to have instantaneous hot filtered water at your disposal. It looks and functions very similar to a deerpark office water cooler, but sits on a countertop and works off your 120 outlet and water supply. So, those are the two aspects that you have to account for. You need to locate this near a water supply. You do not fill it from the tap. It works similarly to a refrigerator, where you need a 1/4\" supply hose to actually use it. I do not recommend it for a kitchen application, as it takes up countertop area. However, it is awesome for a home bar or additional kitchenette area. It is clean and quite. You do need to plan on filter replacements.n Easy set-up. Easy set-up. Hot water is VERY hot. Operating instructions are not very clear. It should be stated that the child safety lock button must be pushed in before engaging the dispenser paddle.n After years of having water delivered!! After years of having water delivered, I'm giving this a shot. Definitely more convenient, cheaper and doesn't make my home feel like an office space with a water cooler. Easy hookup - DIY.n Nicely made, good looking unit. Easy to plumb in and gives you a ready supply of hot or cold filt... Nicely made, good looking unit. Easy to plumb in and gives you a ready supply of hot or cold filtered water. Great for a beverage center in a rec-room or home snack bar type space. Hot water for tea/instant coffee/hot chocolate, and cold water for refreshment. Filter is easy to get to and replace. It does need a permanent connection to a cold water supply and it probably should be on a dedicated circuit, but mine is not.n Cooling coils on the back need to have air circulation, comparable a dorm or office refrigerator. There is a removable catch basin for overflow water, but no provision for a drain line, so be sure the kids know not to just let the water run.n Fantastic bottleless water cooler that fits on the counter! Historically, I have used only bottled water coolers in the home. A few weeks ago, I moved into a large, single-family home where we were using a Brita filter to have drinking water. Since refilling five gallon water bottles is just not financially viable for us, I decided to splurge on this countertop bottleless water cooler and I couldn't be happier. I had my plumber come and install it at the little mini bar at our home and it was up and running in less than an hour.n Have this installed in our new office.

It’s nice to have unlimited water It’s nice to have unlimited water. Think there is to many filters for me because the water tastes like distilled water which makes myself more thirsty. Other than that I am happy for the most part. \"READ AND FOLLOW\" the Instructions for setup to avoid any problems with the setup. We ordered 2 of these water dispenser and coolers for our Company - one of the office and one for our warehouse work area to fill the need of water supply for 2 large groups of employees in two separate work areas. Trying to eliminate the chore of having to purchase cases of bottle water several times a week! Set up a water delivery service and decided it would be better to purchase the cooler rather than paying a monthly rental fee on top of the water delivery service! Turns out to be a wise and cost effective purchase. This is a well known brand and has been very welcomed in the office. Unpacked, plugged in, loaded a bottle of water into it and ready to go!! Employees also like the feature of 3 water temps to choose from! ... for our home for a long time and so happy I stumbled upon this model Been on the market for a water dispenser for our home for a long time and so happy I stumbled upon this model! I wanted a top loader as I feel like bottom loaders doesn’t give me all my water and “empties” as good as top loaders do. This model also has three options: hot, warm or room temp, and ice cold. The hot water can get REALLY hot. Great for coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. Room temp water is a little more colder than warm but works the same. Ice cold water is AMAZING! The machine does have a reservoir, I think of 1 gallon, so when the machine is empty it’ll take a little, maybe 15-20 minutes, for the water to get cold again. Button on the side for hot and cold water.I gave a 4 star because I wish the space to put cups/bottles were a little bigger. I can’t put my 32oz flask on unless I take off the water catcher. But other than that works great!!! Five Stars Working great so far . Simple product that works well Simple cheap and useful, what more does anyone want? Best Cooler on the market for a great price! after reviewing a lot of different water coolers, I went all in and purchased this Brio Essential Bottom Load cooler and I have to say my family and I totally love it!! no more lifting heavy 5 gallon water jugs and killing your back for drinking water. This cooler is great because it does Hot/Cold water and has the option of an off switch if you just want regular room temperature water and also cuts your energy bill by turning off the Hot & Cold switch. Very easy setup, basically plug in and insert your 5 gallon jug at the bottom of the cooler and viola! you have clean purified drinking water and your back is not hurting. I definitely recommend this cooler as I have not been able to come up with any negative aspects of it other than perhaps at night if you want to get a cup of water and the lights are off there is no light on the spout or filler to indicate how full your cup is getting, I think a little light that lights up your cup as you fill it would make this cooler perfect but for me it's totally not a big deal or a deal breaker this cooler is still awesome!! I use to get water delivery service and the vendor rented me their cooler, but when you buy you save money this cooler pays for itself. No more rental fees from the water vendors & no more Chiropractic bills from throwing out your back on a top loading cooler :-) But with Amazon's great customer service we got a replacement fast that all ... The cooler works as advertised, the self cleaning mode works greats. Unfortunately the first one we got the colder water button would not pop back up it would only go half up. But with Amazon's great customer service we got a replacement fast that all the buttons worked fine. Very happy with the purchase. Finally glad we did We were talking about buying a cooler for years. Finally glad we did. Just great. Nor so hot on the hot water, but I bought it for the cold. So that is alright. Five Stars Love this water cooler!! Definitely recommend it Very nice! My son requested this for his new apartment.  So far, he loves it and says he's drinking a lot more water now! Great not having to lift bottles. Really enjoy the dispenser. I would actually give it five stars but it had a vibration noise when heating cooling that I had to place a piece of rolled up foil to buffer. Three Stars The button for the hot water is very hard to use, I am afraid that might break. Five Stars This is great water is really hot and the cold is cold. Love it.. is quite when it runs Style Price So far so good! Very pleased 1st off I'd like to day we have only tested it for a few weeks, but so far it's been great. It is pretty quiet and functions just as well. It would be nice if it had a night light, but we knew that ahead of time. I will say I really like how it has metal parts not just plastic. It even has a place to hang your spout when changing bottles. I definitely think this one is more robust and quieter than the premium model (Oasis brand) we were renting from Le Bleu. So far we are extremely pleased. Five Stars JUST WHAT WE WANTED, HOWEVER MORE! Good looking cooler Good water cooler. I think it looks nicer than other coolers at the same price range. Easy to setup, no problems so far. Annoying. I bought this water dispenser to eliminate the need for constantly buying the 32 cases of water. To be more eco-friendly I suppose. So I did a decent amount of research and decided on this one. It's so disappointing because for some reason it randomly shuts off. So the water that is supposed to be ice cold ends up just being room temperature. I'm not sure why it does this. So when it does this you have to go and unplug it just to get it to run properly again. Maybe mine is broken but this is the issue I have been having. I have only had this thing a week and am currently still on the first water bottle. Hopefully someone contacts me to tell me what I'm doing wrong or to replace this thing. I love this, its super quiet and the temp is ... I love this, its super quiet and the temp is very good. My only complaints: I wish there was a master on/off switch because when it runs low on water, the machine continues to run & you have to unplug it. Also, it needs to indicate which is room temp water and ice cold because honestly, both seem to come out almost the same temp. Not a biggie. Overall a good machine & worth the money. Great unit! Till today there are no issues Great unit!  Till today there are no issues.  I’d bought a unit previously which I had to return.  Brito is much better and $10 less! Works and looks great. My only complain is that the cold and ... Works and looks great.  My only complain is that the cold and room temp are about the same like the option of turning off hot dispenser as described.... cold and hot water....like the option of turning off hot dispenser...... instructions are a little weak.... don't give any info on the hot/cold switches One Star Slow Actually - I really like this unit Actually - I really like this unit.  It's quiet and dispenses the hot and cold water - well - either Very hot or Cold enough.I did see other reviews complaining about the LED Display being 'backwards' and that is true - but honestly - the button with the 'red safety switch' pretty much tells you which spout is going to deliver the hot water - left side for those that can't keep up.  And cold on the right side... isn't that the same way our US water faucets work?  Seriously?Great unit - recommended.  Functions as expected - would buy it again in an instant. The option for room temperature water is good to have Very quite compared to the Primo unit which i had before for 7 years. The option for room temperature water is good to have. An improvement on the door could be usefull by adding a hing to open the door properly...all in all a very effective water dispenser for household use so far. Would recommend for the price compared to other water dispensers at higher prices. Quality construction, quiet delivered in good condition, better water flow than previous cooler. Quiet operation Love the Brio Dispenser Love the Brio Dispenser.  It dispenses quickly and the bottom load feature makes it so much easier to change out the bottle. Extremely loud Works, but it's incredibly loud. Something is missing that's causing it to make a very loud annoying running sound. Five Stars Excellent product, very easy to use and change water.Ursula This water cooler is a perfect addition to my office This water cooler is a perfect addition to my office.  The water is not as cold as I am used to, but we got great service when we called for help... I’m very disappointed. Item is functional but It arrived with damaged faceplate. It is very noticable.  Contacted Brio twice for replacement faceplate.  No response yet. I’m very disappointed. Four Stars Love the water cooler but installation was difficult. Instructions are unclear and couldn’t find any assistance online. Five Stars Great equipment Gud purchase  worth the money Luv it cold water when needed hot when needed perfect Not bad at all. Contrary to other reviews I do not hear that it makes any noise at all. As for the buttons not matching the little drawings, it's pretty self explanatory the one with the big red button is obviously the hot. It's just a matter of using a little common sense. Excellent quality, looks great.  Recommend professional installation It looks great and produces an excellent quality of water! Hired a plumber to complete the install. The unit is in my kitchen but the plumber connected the tubing to pipes in the basement. It was to complex to self install. The part used to periodically clean the new carbon filters will need to be installed separate from the water depenser. Mine was connected to the utility sink in basement. No regrets, I strongly recommend this product. I enjoy having the water bottle on the bottom I enjoy having the water bottle on the bottom.  Much easier for me.  It's great to have the 3 water temperatures. Great looking and safe This is one of the best home cooling units I have ever had its compact the bottle goes in the bottom so it's not sticking out of the top it's got safety on the hot water so when my grandchildren come over they won't accidentally burn themselves Brio is a great product so you can't go wrong and buying this water cooler. Five Stars We are loving are brio water cooler. Great to Have. This is a very nice addition to our home. The instant an always available HOT water is very nice.The only thing that I would change is the \"Ready to use lights on the front of the cabinet.\"  The water dispensing buttons on the top are not marked and dispense water (from Right to Left) \"ROOM TEMP-COLD-HOT\". The Lights show (from Right to Left) ROOM TEMP- HOT- COLD). The HOT and COLD Lights should be swapped. One Star The dispenser was damaged to where it could not be used. sending it back. Pump stopped working I had this delivered on July 7, 2018.  It worked great up until a few days ago. Junk! Right out of the box, unit would not fill tanks...junk! Constantly runs! This is the lowest rating I have ever given on Amazon. This unit looks great. Dispenses the water fast, the cold is cold and the hot is hot. A major issue I am having (and I am hoping it's just a defect in mine) is it constantly runs. I turned off the hot (which is a nice option) but that didn't solve the problem. I have this unit indoors (constant 70 degrees in the house) so it isn't an ambient temperature issue. It is constantly chilling my water. It is louder than my refrigerator and never turns off. I am thinking about returning it. Love it! Out of the box and just plug it in. Switch for the hot water to be turned on is so easy to access right on the side. You can tell this is a well built system. I'm very happy I purchased this unit. Looks very nice too. Best water cooler! I highly recommend this dispenser especially to the elderly. Bottom loading is a God send ! Very easy to start up and use. Thank you Brio! And the safety feature for the hot water dispensing is an ease of mind, when the grandkids are around, they can't get burned.  I would recommend to anyone considering this purchase to get it. It's much nicer than any I could find in our local SAMs or Lowes. Awesome cooler! Love the cooler! Very easy to change a 5-gallon water container. No lifting is needed and you can simply roller the new container inside, unscrew the tap, and enjoy a cold glass of water. Quit working The unit I purchased just quit working a few days past the one month mark of purchasing it. The light comes on showing that the bottle is empty and needs to be replaced but it is a full bottle. There is no hot water and the cool water barely has a trickle of pressure. I'm disappointed and wish it could be replaced. Easy and convenient Came in a huge box but easy to open, I did miss the second button to turn it on but thankfully I found it before I freaked out. Instructions need some more details but I’ve had this now for over a month and love it. We use it for the home and it’s easy to transfer out the jugs. Cooler/heater Issue The cooler/heater stopped working on the day the return window closed. Unit has stopped working The unit I purchased just quit working a few months past the one month mark of purchasing it. The light comes on showing that the bottle is empty and needs to be replaced but it is a full bottle. There is no hot or cool water and the water barely has a trickle of pressure. I'm very unhappy and would like it replaced. Fantastic product No more plastic bottles, no more bottled water of uncertain source.  I made the switch to an in-home cooler/dispenser and I could not be happier.  Switching to the 5-gallon jug took a bit of an adjustment, bought the water at BJs and the biggest adjustment factor has been the taste... but that's a positive.  As much as I was used to taste of the 16-oz bottles, the new taste is great, the water is cold and refreshing, and all at a net savings.  Set up was easy, from removing it from the packaging to peeling off he protective wrapping, to plugging it in, slipping the bottle inside the machine, and enjoying my new savings.  Easy as pie. Fantastic RO water cooler Love this system, especially not having to carry and store the big bottles.  Best way to have hot and cold pure water without the hassle.  Had a plumber install but my husband could have done it. Wish I'd purchased one of these sooner. excruciatingly loud cools and heats well but it makes SO MUCH NOISE! Very quiet Works great, water is hot and cold as it expected to be. Regular temperature option is a good idea, it is useful, but it usually has a pretty low temperature, not room at all. Doesn't produce any noise Scratched up to big to return Mine came all scratched up, looks like someone else returned it... and constantly buzzes so loud. Very upset Water outlet too low Sent back. Water outlet too low No longer works after less than one month of usage. I purchased this cooler on July 17th, 2018 and as of August 15th, 2018 it has stopped working.  The \"Replace Bottle\" light keeps flashing even when a full bottle is inserted.  It seems like it's trying to pump water into the cooling tank based off of the status lights on the front of the cooler, but then it always reverts back to the \"Replace Bottle\" light flashing red.  We were really excited about having this for our clients, but less than one month later it no longer works. Disappointed Mine stopped working after 1 month. Stopped working after 1 month I have had it for 1 month and it quit working Five Stars GREAT PRODUCT This water cooler works great. Well worth the money and I received it ... This water cooler works great. Well worth the money and I received it in no time. I would recommend it. The temperature settings are excellent! It was super easy to set up. I’ve had it for about a month and it’s been working very well. The hot water is very hot and the cold is very cold. It’s easy to switch out the water jugs.  I will say at first I thought something was wrong because in the picture the Brio logo appears to be backlit making it a bright blue. However in person, there is no back lighting behind the logo. It’s a sticker that is a dark blue and not easily visible on the black machine.  But overall, it’s a well functioning machine with a sleek design.  I’ve already recommended it to a friend. Worked amazing for the 1st month Worked great for the first month. Now when i replace water I hear the motor running for a long time and then the red light flashes saying it needs to be changed..  Frustrating Great water dispenser, vibrates loudly at times I really like this water dispenser. Just wish it was quieter...sometimes it starts vibrating loudly. Broke in less than a month The water dispenser broke in less than a month. It leaked all over my kitchen and dining area for no apparent reason..... Not worth the money. I've had this for 40 days and the pump already stopped working. Garbage. Works great but the room temp water is more cold then ... Works great but the room temp water is more cold then room temp. I just do half cold and half hot water to get that temp. Hot is very very hot Love it. Had it for a month now. Matches all of our other appliances and just quietly sits there with cold water on tap. We got what we wanted. UPDATED: Better the second time around. UPDATED FROM PRIOR REVIEW: The seller responded to my review and sent us a new unit. It works much better. I still wish the hot and cold water was a little more consistent but the new dispenser provides much better heating and cooling. The buttons do not stick and the pressure is better. I appreciate the seller's willingness to work with us on this and, because of this, would recommend trying this unit out.We bought this in May 2018 to replace one from another company we had for years. We loved the look of it and the bottom loading water option. Unfortunately, this machine is truly lousy. It doesn't produce cold water consistently, the buttons get stuck, the hot water isn't always hot enough. It's hard to get the water jug hooked up right and the water pressure is terrible. I miss our old, ugly water dispenser. Five Stars Very good product, excellent quality... Great, for a month, then broke This was rear until it stopped working.  After a month of use the pump stopped pumping water to be dispensed. Five Stars Loved this water dispenser Don’t order this is my second one This is the worst product I’ve ever ordered from amazon. It keeps shorting out and now it won’t work at all. IT LEAKS It LEAKS!!! We Have only used it for 2 weeks!! Works good! Works good! Hit and miss I bought this and it worked for about a week and a half then stopped producing cold water.  Did not want to wait for an exchange, so I ordered another one and as soon as that one was plugged in, it made loud noises/vibrations... and not good vibrations like The Beach Boys song. That one was sent back too.  I gave up.Strangely, I’ve had good experience so far with another one before this purchase. I wish they were consistent. Not reliable Stopped drawing/dispensing water properly after 6 months of normal use. Great Product Works great, looks good.  Very quite operation.  Cold water gets very cold.  Very happy with this product. Es bien ueno Bueno Great Water Cooler!! Looks Great; easy to setup; water is nice and cold and it is a wonderful addition to our family room, replacing our old water cooler that lasted many years. This cooler looks a lot nicer and is quieter than our old one! Thanks! Defective It’s defective does not work todo bien todo bien Do not purchase Extremely noisey.  This unit rattles all day long and sounds horrible Terrible quality! Do NOT buy this item! I ordered it back in April and it’s already broken! I wish I could return it as it’s so expensive and I was expecting something of good quality! What a disappointment. It doesn’t have a light like my old one but still nice. Very nice cooler! Good machine so far. I’ve been using this for about a month, and it has been working exactly like it should. It’s easy to load and unload/switch water bottles. The hot water is VERY hot. The cold water is arctic. For the price, i would expect better Adjusting rating. It worked for a solid two months and then just stopped working. Great while it worked but now it has the constant red flashing light, no matter what I do. Leaving the two stars for look and ease of use while it was working Garbage product Broke after 2 months, garbage product!!! Water stopped  coming out of dispensers. Waste a lot of water I don’t like this product, because it waste a lot of water. In order to get 2 glasses of clean water, it dumped over a gallon of water. Stopped Working Within weeks of purchase the machine has stopped working - RED light came on despite of a brand new OZARKA bottle replaced three times. WASTE OF MONEY, WASTE OF TIME AND WASTE OF WATER. I will not advise to buy this USELESS machine. Great purchase! Been using it for over a week now, it’s great. Don't buy this product I do not recommend this product. It died just after 5 months of use. The motor, when it did work was very loud. I am giving it a star because it did work, if only temporarily. I spent way too much money for it to no longer work! Extremely disappointed! Does not work Just received mine yesterday and the cold and hot water does not work. Troubleshoot and it says turn on the hot water switch in the back.....there is no switch. Works great! One of the best purchases we’ve made. Hot, cold, or temperature water right away. So happy so far! Push buttons stick then it dumps your water all over the place. The push buttons to dispense the water are made of thin plastic and spring load. When pushed down the buttons stick. They do not pop back up. The water keeps pouring out. This happens with both the refrigerated cold and the room temperature buttons. I did not try the hot water button in fear it would burn my feet. Not good. The picture shows the button stuck in the dispense position with water all over the floor. I had to pull the 3 gallon water jug off to avoid flooding. We have a butter knife next to the cooler to pop the button back up.  But, you need to be ready with a bucket or an empty jug to grab the water . I don’t understand this damn machine!! There is ... I don’t understand this damn machine!! There is no cold water and where there is a picture of snow flake, boiling water coming out!! I’m about to return this thing!! It doesn’t seem to be working right!! Like the hidde bottle Least like difficulty in finding water ... Like the hidde bottleLeast like difficulty in finding water outlets Breaks Bought in June and stopped working. The refil indicator is flashing and no water is dispensing. Also, the hot water button started to stick.  I’ve trouble shot every possible scenario and nothing is working. I’m contacting the company next. Love it This was an excellent addition to our kitchen. The family drinks so much more water now and we have hot water in demand. It’s easy to use as well. Love it. Do Not Buy! Terrible! We should have returned it a month after we bought it but instead we’ve been dealing with it. Sometimes it works ok but usually it thinks the bottle is empty when it’s not. This is perfect! No hum Looking for a cooler that doesn't make noise! This is perfect! No hum. Cheap and useless - Broke completely within 6 months No customer support, no product manual to troubleshoot an issue, no warranty information, no contact to resolve the issues. This is called a RIP OFF  PRODUCT!Noisy, leaky and very cheap quality. It stopped functioning completely with the red LED blinking continuously despite water in the bottom load.Amazon should ban such cheap quality products sounds like screws missing around cabinet of it the unit vibrates loud, sounds like screws missing around cabinet of it. Great machine. Quiet. Great hot and cold water. The dispenser is clean looking. Not too tall. Easy to load. It arrived quickly. Worth every penny. Crappy product. Period. Product is not very sturdy, doesn’t heat or cool water very well, stopped working after a couple months and leaked water ALL over my kitchen!!  What a waste of my birthday $$. Could not find the correct replacement filters. We like this water dispenser. However, I would not recommend buying it because there are no replacement filters available. Their website is not helpful. Broke in 6 months I bought this in JUNE it has not been 6 months and it is BROKEN. WASTE OF MONEY Please stay away from this unit. As the others have stated, 6 months and the pump goes out. Well this unit was ordered for a senior due to weight constrictions and lifting, failure of the pump in such a very short period with Bottled purified, plain old water from A major Supplier that has ahem, so standards, water to fail is not tolerated at all. 5+ months and about 600 gallons later, pump failure is unacceptable. Warranty is a joke. Now this entire unit is hazardous waste due to Freon and oil. It stopped working after 3 months Don’t buy this! I purchased one for my house and one for my sister. Mine stopped working in 3 months and hers stopped working after 4 months. The water wouldn’t come up from the bottle. We had to return them to amazon and bought another brand. The only good thing I can say about it is that it looks really nice. Looking nice is not gonna cut it when u can’t even get a year out of the product great customer service had a problem with the first one received with hot water leaking. called Brio warranty and they where excellent couldn't be fixed so they sent me a new one as soon i the broken was mailed out. customer service was excellent. Failed after eight months with no warranty I spent one-fourth of a month's rent on this thing, and it failed after eight months... It constantly tells me I need to refill the water, but I have a full bottle in there. Opened it up and fiddled with it, cleaned the water tank... Nothing :/And there's no warranty, to boot!Save your money and buy one with a warranty. Worked Great for 9 months...now leaking The product worked great for less than 9 months.  Very hot water.  Very cold water.  A little buzzy during heating and cooling, but not too bad.  Yesterday, I noticed a flood in my kitchen.  The product is now leaking and unusable.  I am unable to contact the seller about this order through amazon.  There is no warranty info.  Very disappointing.  I spent $180 on this. STOPPED WORKING I bought this water cooler July 19th 2018, it started making VERY loud noises by the end of August. Unplugged it a few times and re plugged it and it eventually stopped making the noises. We were VERY happy with this cooler, when it worked! We even had the next door office coming by and using our water because they enjoyed it much more! By the beginning of October, it just stopped working all together. I Have been trying to return the item but there is no information on how or where to return the product or at least get a refund from the broken cooler. I am very disappointed in regards to the service since there is no where to hear from or point of contact. Originally a 5 star cooler turned to 1 star instantly. Very disappointed. IT DOESN'T WORK LIGHTS FLASH THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN THEM OFF .  I HATE THIS ITEM AND WISH TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. Stopped working within 6 months Stopped working right around the 6 month mark. Refill light continues to blink even with full water bottle in place. BUYER BEWARE - No Replacement Filters Available! Nice machine until it's time to replace filters.  Replacement filters not found ANYWHERE!!!  Was directed by Brio to contact Organize.  What a pathetic joke they are.  No one there answers the phone during normal business hours and they never return messages.  Their website is useless because there are no pictures of the filters so you have no clue what you're looking at.  DO NOT BUY!  You'll be putting it on the boulevard for garbage pick up when filter replacement time comes around.  Everyone involved in the sale and manufacture of this needs to be ashamed, or sued. GREAT PURCHASE! Great product! We wasted SO much money on water bottles for the office and now that we have this installed it saves so much money on bottles and is very clean looking. Love that it does both HOT & COLD water. Perfect for making instant coffee or hot chocolate of even adding it to your Cup Ramen! Five Stars This is so much easier to use than the top load unit we had before! Highly recommend this cooler! Love this water cooler/heater! Sleek look, easy setup, quiet, simple to load. No weird taste in the water like there is in the top loading coolers when they are new. A couple of suggestions to the seller... include a shorter feed tube for the option to use 3 gallon water jugs and it would make more sense to line up your cooling and heating indicators with the buttons that dispense the cool and hot water. A bit confusing for some. ANOTHER GREAT BRIO Awesome cooler looks similar to the filter cooler we purchased from brio the quality is great water is cold and they offer great technical support on setting up the unit. Five Stars great product would buy again Great product. Disagree with some reviews Great product. Disagree with some reviews. The buttons aren’t labeled but easy to figure out.  Not always making noise and when does turn on not loud at all. The hot water is good enough for tea. The bottom load just seems less cluttered also and easy to swap water bottles. ... and opened it and ill tell you this is great no damage at all i plugged it up and ... this is boxed extremely well i got it out and opened it and ill tell you this is great no damage at all i plugged it up and waited to see how hot the water got it didnt take long  the  child proof lock on it works well so i dont have to worry about any accidents and ill tell you that is why i got this for this  for that and the price and i love the fact of the anitbacterial shield overall this is great no problems with it at all im glad i bought it Disclosure: “I have been given  this product as part of a product review . Although the product was a gift, all opinions in this review remain my own and I was in no way influenced by the company.“ Five Stars So nice! Love it! BEST Drinking Water Filter Water Cooler - Ever! Brio Commercial Grade Bottleless Ultra Safe Reverse Osmosis Drinking Water Filter Water Cooler Dispenser-3 Temperature Settings Hot, Cold & Room Water - UL/Energy Star Approved - Point of UseSome background information about myself. I live alone and am a student. Given these circumstances, I need to be as efficient as possible. I stumbled across this future-esque product. Not only was I extremely happy about my purchase, but it blew my expectations. In terms of efficiency, it doesn't get any better than this. It comes with a room temperature water dispenser, hot, and cold! Longevity wise, this product is going to last for many years to come (stainless steel). It looks amazing, high-tech, but don't let that fool you it's extremely user friendly and easy to use for the average consumer. It has a four-stage reverse osmosis system which cleans, purifies, and keeps water flowing at a proper pressure.Switching from water bottles to this has saved me a lot of money. When I have a guest that comes over, I can make them a coffee/tea, give them ice cold water, or room temperature water in seconds.Best water product on the market hands down. Five Stars Exactly as descibed - fast delivery One Star this cooler failed after 3 days of use, no warm water !!! requested replacement, no work from the seller ... lot of noise as well would have bought something better if I would've known The pump makes to much noise when you go to get water and it keeps on trying to get water when it is empty have to unplug the heater for the hot said makes a lot of noise as well would have bought something better if I would've known Just need An answer!! Cannot get an answer from anybody!!! The room temp water is almost as cold as the cold water. is this normal ? Do I need to return. Cannot find customer service phone or email. Five Stars just what I wanted nice and look good set up. Five Stars works great we love it very much Don't buy this! I liked the size and that the hot water was plenty hot. Beyond that it was terrible! It's super loud, at times the \"room temp\" water would come out hot and in only 2.5 months it completely broke and water was everywhere coming from where the motor cools it. Not a problem caused by overfilling. I would not recommend it to anyone! If yours stop working (Dispensing Water) FYIA quick and easy solution to the issue where it is a bit noisy or where is just continues to make a sound and never will dispense water.Just move the bottle out a bit to where you have access to the small pump in the top right corner inside (just follow the water tube from bottle) and simple take about 4 inch piece of electrical tape and wrap it firmly around tube connection to pump  on both the front and the back.The pump needs a good seal to create a siphon and the water connection(s) to the pump are a weak spot and with pulling out the water bottle during change you place a bit of strain on that connection. Hot water button sticks. Be careful!  I bought this water dispenser in Late July 2018. Up until a few weeks ago, we loved it. Recently, the hot water button (child lock) becomes stuck when using it. getting the button to free up and stop dispensing near boiling water is the hard part. I am unsure if anyone else has run into this issue. I did contact Amazon but the informed me that it was passed the return date within their policy (30 days) and put me in contact with the seller. The seller response so far has be the following, \"Thank you for reaching out to us!We sincerely apologize for your inconveniencesWe have brought this product issue to our R and D department and once we have a response from them, we will emailwith either troubleshooting instructions for this product or a resolution if we were recommended from the R and D department to proceed further.We thank you for your continued patience and understandingBest regards\"If they do come up with a resolution, I will update this review.(02/04/19) Great product, very hot and cold water Great product, very hot and cold water, very happy, only thing i wish is it had a light but not that big of a deal Can't find the replacement filters. I would not recommend buying it because there are no replacement filters. Great item! It's a great item. I've had it for a year without any problems. I really like it! Impossible to clean and gets moldy! The water dispenser worked fine but after two months of using it the water tasted dusty and dirty when dispensed from the Brio. It was collecting mold and there is no way to clean it. Do not buy this dispenser or if buying make sure there is a servicing contract that includes cleaning the dispenser. This is of no use for us unless we clean the mold out. Work good Work great!!! Bring all the stuff needed to install it. But instructions of how operate it are incomplete. Does Not have instructions about the switches at the back of water cooler. Switches aren't labeled also. easy to set up and we are thrilled with it My husband and I had rented a cold/hot water dispenser from our local water company for years.  We had been having it replaced several times over the years and finally decided we would buy our own.  We are getting up in years and wanted one that we did not have to lift the heavy 5 gallon jug of water (which was getting really hard to lift) over our heads.  We did our research and this Brio seemed to fill the bill.  It came quickly, easy to set up and we are thrilled with it.  Only problem is the lights.  They certainly are screwy.  The cold and hot lights are switched.  Sometimes they work, most of the time they don't.  We have just learned to adjust; and after reading other reviews we discover that this is a common problem and it is not worth the cost of sending the product back.  With just the two of us in the house to educate about the \"light situation\" it is not an issue for us.  We live in the country and have well water. We prefer not to drink the water.  Therefore, this is our answer for pure drinking water that is delivered to our door.  It is an attractive unit and we are very happy with our purchase.  Thank you!! Great Product 01/11/2019 - I purchased this water cooler in August, 2018 - So far, so good. Out of the box, no problems.  I like the fact that I can turn-off the hot water, the cold water and have water at room temp (in the summer I enjoyed the really cold water), now it's winter and room temp is perfect for me.  I use the hot water (and its good and hot) each morning for coffee (then I turn it off).  At the time I purchased this item, the price was $149.99, zero s/h as I'm a prime member. Motor burned up! I’m really disappointed to have to report that I bought this machine in July and the motor is already broken in late December. I paid too much for it not to last even six months! Operates fine. Water is very cold/hot when selected Ehh... It's just okay. Buttons feel cheap. Needs a light for dispensing water st night. Operates fine. Water is very cold/hot when selected. Not very loud either. I'd say it's just \"okay\" Extremely Disappointed I purchased this cooler on August 18th, 2018 and as of January 12th, 2018 it has stopped working. The \"Replace Bottle\" light keeps flashing even when a full bottle is inserted. It seems like it's trying to pump water into the cooling tank based off of the status lights on the front of the cooler, but then it always reverts back to the \"Replace Bottle\" light flashing red. I was extremely excited about about this unit. As a single mother it was a blessing. However, now it’s a huge hardship on me and my family. I’m so sad now. If you like throwing your money away by this product The pump stopped working with in maybe 15 5 gallon bottles horrible product would not wish this for anyone to own and less you like wasting your money If anything happened to my cool the can  fix it for me It is the great water cooling I like it so much it is helpful For me and my family the only thing they didn’t put the name on  top of machine and the signs for the water  so you can know if it’s cold or hot I do not recommend Pump broke after 6 months So far so good - it was packaged really good - not a ... So far so good - it was packaged really good - not a scratch on it. Also the water is very cold and the hot is very hot I say this bc I had issues in the past with other cooler vendors that the water was barely cold .. this one is cold. So far a great purchase. Shame on you Brio. Every here of water shortage or how about a water bill? DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ENERGY OR MONEY ON THIS SELF CLEANING WATER COOLER BY BRIO.  AFTER HAVING BUYING THIS PRODUCT AND PAYING FOR IT TO BE PROFESSIONALLY INSTALLED,  THATS WHEN THE HORROR HAPPENED. Mind you first of all this is an energy star, i wonder if energy star knows how wasteful this PRODUCT is. For every cup of water you pure to consume at LEAST 10 times that runs through the waist line . This product will cost a fortune in water bill alone. Irritated Mine started leaking! It was working great till one day we came home and water was all over the floor. Broken 2x in less than a year About to replace this poor purchase.  At the time I bought it had good reviews.  Within a few months it started making a loud noise then stopped working.  We had it replace, but the company wanted me to pay for shipping the broken one.  Got the replacement and again it broke.  Don't waste your money. Grear value for your money so far so good. just wish there was a standard no-spill cap with it. our last one did but it costed a lot more 5 years ago. Thumbs up ! A must have for health This is the only company using copper free internal parts and non bpa plastics . Awesome to know they went the extra step in engineering ! Much appreciated No cold water... The unit is heating water across across cold, room, and hot temperatures. No cold water...returning. Good Good Lasted only 6 months I am very disappointed in this product. I purchased 2 of them and within 6 months both were malfunctioning. Now I am stuck with 2 water coolers I can't use or return. Will not and did not buy item again. BEST COOLER OUT OF 4 DIFFERENT ONES I purchased this cooler for my kitchen as a gift for my parents anniversary I am very impressed with the shiny stainless steal on the front panel. I purchased a few other ones less expensive for my garage and my parents garage how ever the additional 50-75$ we paid for this cooler was worth every penny, you truly get what you pay for.The cooler makes very cold water and the hot is very hot, hot enough to make tea, out my favorite cup of noodles I really like that. Some of the other coolers I purchased were not as cold. There user manual really helps you get set up make sure to readFor sure buy.!!!!! One Star Please don't buy it Does not work!!! I am on #4...none of them worked. you follow the set up directions and everything seems to be working fine then it starts spitting and leaking water all over inside and out. I have wasted 4 different 5 gallons of bottled water. We took video and pictures of the malfunctioning machines and worked with the company that ships them and they sent out stickers for shipping for return and replaced them 4 times but I am tired of packing them up and sending them back. Maybe because we live above 9400 Feet above sea level is the reason they do not work. Time to try a different one. STOPPED 200+ $$$ broken We purchased this dispenser in August 2018 5 month not pumping water red light stays on this is unacceptable Amazon should help the customers who this supplier will not support Unable to get replacement filters for this cooler. Unable to get replacement filters for this Water Cooler.  Everyone is having the same problem. No cold water I lmreally likes the water cooler until about a mont ago (I bought in October) the cold water started making a noise and is no longer working The pitcher leaked one month into owning the device. ... The pitcher leaked one month into owning the device. Buy at your own risk. I'll purchase a different brand.One star is if you only need the thing for a month. Love the bottom load! Love this with the room temperature option. Bottom load is so much easier. Matches with other kitchensppliancrs Works very well. Nice looking too. Never order this product Worst water dispenser I have ever ordered. It’s been only theee months and it broke already Pretty decent Some hum when the condenser is running but not intrusive. The bottom grill where spill water collects is a bit flimsy Five Stars I am very happy with this product it works great Doesnt work. I was really excited for this dispenser. Instructions said to keep upright for minimum of 2 hours before hooking up. Did that and nothing happened. Left it standing over at home while at work, came home and still not working. Will be returning.  What a let down. Two Stars Its now a few months after purchase and the water pump has gotten much louder. The reviews are true Totally worth it.  It tucks away nicely.  The hot/cold/room temp water is really nice to have.  So much easier than having a top loading unit. It’s very easy to set up and use It’s only been a few days but I reallly appreciate having water so readily available.  It’s very easy to set up and use. Compre este producto debido a las buenas recomendaciones que tenia ... Compre este producto debido a las buenas recomendaciones que tenia  y  me gustaba su funcionamiento. me sentía a gusto con el pero en menos de tres meses se me rompió. dejó de funcionar. actualmente no puedo devolverlo ni cambiarlo. recomiendo a todo el que lo compre lo asegure pues el plazo de devolución es muy corto. The hot water is extremely hot and is good for making green tea Can't figure out how to work the cold water. The hot water is extremely hot and is good for making green tea. LOVED IT TILL IT STOPPED PUMPING LESS THAN 3 MONTHS IN JUNE 9, 2018LOVE IT. OUR OLD ONE FINALLY QUIT. I LOVE THIS ONE  BECAUSE OF THE EASY ACCESS TO LOAD IN THE BOTTLED WATER. OUR OLD ONE I HAD TO LIFT UP TO THE TOP IF HUBBY WASN'T HOME. THIS ONE SLIDES EASY IN THE BOTTOM. NICE AND COLD! AUGUST 6, 2018.....THAT COMMENT WAS WHEN I BOUGHT IT......3 DAYS SHORT OF IT TURNING 3 MONTHS OLD, IT STOPPED WORKING. THANKS TO MIKE B. FROM AMAZON WHO HELPED ME RESOLVE THE ISSUE. BRIO SUCKS...BUT THEIR PUMPS DON'T....NOT IN MY CASE ANYWAY. Easy, Refreshing, sleek design This has made our life so much easier! Very easy to set up, and water comes out cold/hot as expected. Looks much sleeker than most water coolers. I would recommend! Stopped working after 45 days The red blinking empty bottle light is always on and no water comes out even if there is a full bottle Broken items always!!! This I as my second time dealing with this brand !Its most BAD brand ever !!!😡 Runs quiet just be sure to follow set up instructions so as not to ruin it. Water bottles are easy to load so even my wife can do it.It seems that the cold water isn't always cold ,sometimes it doesn't seem to chill the water. Five Stars good quality! Not a complete product This product don't come with the required filters so far its working great! hot is very hot and cold is very ... have had this for about  months.  ordered and had it shipped directly to my office.  no problems with shipping (no crushed box, etc).  so far its working great!  hot is very hot and cold is very cold.  has a  room temp spout which i wasn't expecting but is a nice addition. Four Stars As described Being a little old I really like that I can load the bottle from bottom and ... Being a little old I really like that I can load the bottle from bottom and not from the top, those do get heavy as you age. The only small problem I have is there is no light to see when you fill a cup/glass. But all in all it is a great product. Broken in 1-2 months. Adjusted Rating. This product works for about 1-2 months. Now not only does it not work, but the is no customer service. I have been trying to find customer service for this product and there doesn't seem to be any. I am so thirsty and angry I wish I never bought this brand. See for yourself, there is no customer service for this product according to google. And all of the Youtube videos focus on different brands. Good quality Easy to set up and easy to load. Works great! One Star looked good but worked for a month only and now it is useless Five Stars There is really nothing I didn't like. Good product. Do not buy After two months the red flashing light stays on and it will not pump water. Tried all the repairs suggested and it’s still not working. Expensive machine to have break so quickly. Would not buy again and of course it’s just outside of the return window. This makes drinking water fun! way cheaper rand easier option than plastic bottles This makes drinking water fun! way cheaper rand easier option than plastic bottles. Reduce my plastic footprint one bottle at a time. Five Stars So far it is the best water dispenser I have ever owned I love my new water dispenser I love my new water dispenser. It is good looking, works great and is very quiet. I like that I can shut off (with a button on the side) the hot or cold water should I want to. I actually only need hot water on for cooking purposes etc. I am very pleased with it so far after about a months time and would highly recommend it. Stopped working after less than 60 days. I was very happy with this water dispenser until it completely stopped working after less than 60 days. Amazon was responsive and allowed me to ship it back to them for a refund minus a fee, but it was still a hassle to box it back up. I called the number on the warranty card (Downtown wholesalers) and they were nice enough, but they said I had to work through Amazon. You might want to try a different brand or model. Five Stars great water cooler Stay Away Bought it 3 month ago, already replaced once and it does not work well.  First one would not heat the water after one month.  Second one heats the water too much so some plastic inside melts and ends up in the water.  Stay Away.Don't even know how to return to Amazon now. Light doesn't work. Space for bottles is too short ... Light doesn't work.  Space for bottles is too short.  Platform to rest cup/bottle is not deep enough to support my glassware. Good price Very good has cold cold water and hot water 5 stars for this one Five Stars perfect size fits just about any tight space. makes no noise and water is cold instantly. Perfect Exactly what we wanted and quick shipping Trash Trash Good quality and good price Couldn’t beat the price. I was looking for a bottom loading water dispenser and could not find one for a reasonable price until I came across this one. Very clean looking with the stainless steel finish and makes water ice cold ! Good quality ! Five Stars Much easier to load water than the top-loading ones. Leaks water all over Terrible, leaks water and amazon customer service sends you to the manufacturer whom doesn’t want to help as well. Will never buy again ! I need someone fix . Product is not work after 1 month. Defective product.  Company not easy to work with. Product was defective.  Months later I am still waiting for a full refund. Cold & Hot water with style So far so good, 4 bottles later and I still love this.  I understand the reviewers who really want the lights to align to the buttons, but the lights really only lite up to tell you it's cooling or heating the water (they're not on most of the time).  Detects an empty bottle spot on.  Very easy to replace bottles and awfully smart that they have a hook to hang the siphon assembly.  Whisper quiet (though sometimes you need to move a new bottle around slightly so it's not pushing anything in a way that causes vibration).Right is cold, left is hot (with the safety), middle is room temp.  Cold is satisfyingly cold.  No complaints at all, would buy another. Great tasting water We bought this cooler for in home use and had a plumber install it. So far this water cooler has met our expectations, the water taste great, and the hot water spout is great for a quick cup of tea. My only concern so far is that I haven't been able to find replacement filters. We still have a while before we have to replace them but the fact that they are not already available concerns me. Stop looking at reviews. Best value for the money. It works great and the bottom storage is great. To address some reviews yes indicator lights are“backwards”So what!Look at your sink left is HOT.  Easy to help those who need help put a label on it. Had some noise at first but that was the fill hose against the cabinet. Easy fix. Just move it.  The only thing I can’t review is the reliability. Only a few weeks old, But seems to be built well. Good: -Bottom loading is so convenient Good:-Bottom loading is so convenient.-Hot or cold water is a nice touch versus just room temp.-Saves space and looks high-end.Bad/Irritating:- Buttons on top don't have the same order of the Hot/Cold/Room Temp icons on front. This is a bit annoying because there are 3 separate nozzles for dispensing the water. Pick the wrong one and you have spills, and with hot water, that could be bad.- Reservoir for hot or cold water is too small. It runs out quickly and then takes a long time to prepare the next batch of hot or cold water. easy to change water bottles very quiet. easy to change water bottles. Exactly what I wanted Gives very old and very hot! Very satisfied! Arrived damaged. Product arrived damaged so it was returned. Great product! Would highly recommend this water cooler.  Hot water is very hot.  I use it to speed up cooking.  Perfect for our lake house where the water is not good to drink. Ease of bottom loading is wonderful. Would recommend this product. Five Stars After less than one month of use, one of the three water spouts started leaking. The amount water leaking out of it was enough to fill a glass in about 10 minutes. We had to return the water dispenser. Searching on advertise Good Unsatisfactory Bought this item and broke 1 month later. Never moved it or did anything to it and now it doesn't work Bought it in March and in June it isn't working anymore... It doesn't want to pull the water up no more Clean and easy to load! Great product! Arrived on time, & in excellent (new) condition. Start up procedure went without a hitch. This unit is a great looking addition to our kitchen! Easy to use Easy to set up. Very quiet. Hot water is very hot. Cold takes a few seconds, but the operation of this equipment is fine. Child proof hot water. Its all that it says it is! And child proof for the hot water! Unit Completely stopped after less than 90 days. Unit completely failed working within 90 days. Unfortunate as it worked well before that but I can  Not Recommend no longer than it actually functioned at the price. I don’t wanted to see it any single time. There is no cold water, the two lights on blink non stop.I never think it will be returning, so my husband discarded the box,I will take it back to the Amazon to fix for me or give me the new one. Please would you like to give me the right address of Amazon in Minnesota. Thank you because it so effected me a lot. Don’t purchase this After one week of use, I came into my kitchen to see the water pouring out of the spout without any of the buttons being pressed or stuck. the customer service was excellent, and I received a full refund The hot/cold water stop working after a few weeks of purchasing. It only produced warm water. Although the product didn't work, the customer service was excellent, and I received a full refund. Four Stars It works and is great so far. I have not had any issues yet. Cold and hot water. I was significantly disappointed in this cooler I was significantly disappointed in this cooler. The cold water is simply not cold enough. My last, much cheaper, cooler had a temperature gauge and the water could me made to be very cold. Based on the high ratings of this cooler on Amazon, I would have thought I was going to receive an upgrade, not lose features. Dented because packaging sucked. The aluminum part is weak and came in dented greatly. The heating part isn't working correctly. Quick and Easy Set Up, Works as Advertised I don't like leaving reviews when I haven't had the product for very long, but I'll give it to this oneIt was very easy to set up, its hot and cold functions were ready fairly quickly, the instructions were very clear, and the bottom loading option is really nice, no splashed water on my floorI was a little confused between what button was for cold and what was for room temp when we first set it up, but it only takes one time of pouring room temp water to figure out that's not the cold button.I'll also note unlike top loaded coolers where after you release the button there's a short delay of dripping, this thing totally stops flow as soon as your finger leaves the button, which is great for reducing water spillage.The cooler has a hot and cold light indicator, when the light turns OFF, its ready, it also has an indicator light for when your water jug needs to be swapped out which is very nice so you're not having to open the door and check on a regular basis.Note that this thing has a radiator in the back of it, so to keep it functioning fully (especially if you have pets that shed really bad) make sure you're clearing the back grate often, and don't place it flush with a wall.I got this thing because I was alarmed a month or so ago by how much I was spending on water bottles every month, so far this thing is paying for itself.It looks good (I hate the tacky seeing the huge jug on the top loaded coolers) and stands roughly 4 feet tall (using my own height as a reference point here I have not actually measured it)What can I say, it works as advertised Dies in less than 2 months. This water dispenser worked great for just under 2 months. But now, just before the 2 month mark the pump has stopped pumping water. We can hear the pump try to pump but no water gets pulled up from the water bottle.  For what we paid for this, it should have lasted longer. It worked great until it didn't work at all. VERY FRUSTRATING. This was the second one I order the first one ... This was the second one I order the first one didn’t work for the cold.the second one Didn’t work at all!!!!!!!!! Easy to install full bottle of 5 gallon water I had two top loaded water dispenser before, loading the five gallon water bottle is always challenging for me. The main reason to buy bottom loaded dispenser is to solve the problem. So far so good, I like my purchase I liked the fact that is small and was easy to ... I liked the fact that is small and was easy to setup.  I didn’t like the fact it can with out the drain tray and can’t get one from the manufacturer Two Stars used it for one week, began to leak at the bottom. Returning now Not Worth It Product arrived with a dent where the door is for the bottom load. No idicator on the buttons for hot, room temp or cold dispensers. Definitely not worth it. Poor customer service on top of all that. Do not buy, better machines available from a better seller. Filters our AZ tap water beautifully! I only wish the cold water was colder ... Filters our AZ tap water beautifully! I only wish the cold water was colder and that you could actually fit a water bottle under the water dispenser. Five Stars Loved the style and the ease of loading the water bottles. Doesn’t work and no phone number to call. 2 problems made me return it back.  (1)No water came out after 4 hours.  (2) The water line did not connect securely.  Only went in a tiny bit.  We beveled it too but it never went all the way in.  Anyway,  the manual has no phone number to call about our problems.  Very odd.  It leaked after 4 hours from the water line. What a complete waste of time BE WARNED!!! This doesn't come with filters and you can't find them anywhere. What a complete waste of time. Easy to set up and load It works as advertised. Have not tried the hot water though. Downside is that you can hear it running, which can be aggravating even though it is basically quiet! Have now bought two. One as a gift and plan on sending another as a gift. LOVE that it bottom loads. Good product. I've had this product for almost 3 weeks so far so good. I love the easy access to hot water... Issue with room temp water, installation instruction and no filters sale on the market I like the product so far but there are 3 issues that I experienced. 1, no filter for sale in current market. I just realized after purchased and shipment. 2, poor installation and start up instructions. 3, there is not a continuous flow ambient water. I could have it only 1 cup and then no more flow. Stopped working It broke a couple of months after I got it. Even with a full container the red light comes on indicating that there is no water. Was working fine upto a week ago. Was thinking to send it back but even though there is one year warranty for this product Amazon tells me that the return window has already passed. The Ŵíndów seems to be a month long. I am going through contact the seller directly. Five Stars Good stuff. Best thing I've bought in a long time. Perfect product, we are very happy Perfect product , we are very happy! It’s a handsome dispenser, but returning. The hot water dispenser is no more than a trickle. It takes more than two minutes to get a 1/2 cup of hot water out. Tried emailing for help, but no response. Sending back for refund this week. First use tasted like plastic Working great! Cool, not cold The lower bottle position is very convenient. The motor draws the water easily. It occasionally hums a bit and the water is cool, not chilled. Not working good It is no good not working  properly I want to return Too pricey Not a good value for the money. Arrived damaged. I just received it today, but it seems to ... I just received it today, but it seems to be working well. If anything changes, I'll be sure to update. Hot water The water is plenty hot for my instant coffee in the morning. The coldest water is cold but not particularly Ice cold. There is three separate spouts and it is quiet. A little noise when it comes on but very tolerable. Love it, my husband can't stop raving about it! Works 10x better than the one we got from Menards. Very quiet and the pump doesn't try to work when there is no water left in the tank. It does leave a bit of water in the bottle but that's just fine with me. One Star Package came as damaged and the  dispenser had big dent & ding on it. Read the production description carefully. I like this water dispenser.  It is sleek looking, the cold water is cold and the hot, very hot.  Although the set-up directions are clear there is a little confusion about when exactly to turn on the power switches and when to prime the pump.Be careful reading the product description.  If, like me, you are looking for a dispenser that accommodates both 3 gallon and 5 gallon jugs, and that those jugs be readily interchangeable, you will be disappointed.  The dispenser is set up to take 5 gallon jugs. If you wish to use a 3 gallon jug then you have to cut the tube that goes into the jugs, which would then make it only useful for 3 gallon jugs. I was a little bit disappointed by this unexpected revelation. Easy to use and saves time This came in a big shipping box and within it had the main box with the water cooler. It was easy to unpack and setup. Only had to put drip tray in and get a full water bottle. Which you can get from any grocery store or Walmart or just get it delivered like I do,  Looks great! Fits in with my decor great. It took less than 5 minutes to cool and heat water. I like the 3 options it has for hot, cold and room temp water. Everything I need in my household for my water supply. We have well water and do not cook with it or drink. This #watercooler makes it so easy to make any hot drink. No waiting for the water to heat in the microwave or cool in the refrigerator for cold water. The room temp is nice to use for many of my cooking & baking needs. Which is one of my favorite this to do. It has to switches on the left side to turn off the heating or cooling of water, great energy saving feature. It is easy to move without a full water bottle and does not need a lot of room. Just make sure it has room to vent per manufacturers owners manual. Five Stars great and fast service. I like it, but.. I like it.. but I wish...#1  ... the fill area was a bit deeper.  My coffee cup is 3.5\" round,  the tray is 3\" deep.#2  .. that it came with Hot, Cold, Room, labels for the water dispensers.  The hot I have figured out, but I have to guess on the others ones.I like thats it's quiet, no vibration noise like the old water cooler, and no tank to pick up, and not much of a chance for a leak. Bought this as a gag gift to throw my husband ... Bought this as a gag gift to throw my husband off the scent of his real gift but had hopes of actually keeping it. He deciced he wouldn't use it so we returned it for a fee. It was still worth the $16 though. It was delivered promptly and in good condition and set up was easy We had another cooler by some other company but it went out in one year and was noisy. We bought the Brio and it is everything that they said it was. It was delivered promptly and in good condition and set up was easy. Had it working the same day and so far we have had no problems with it. Like the way it was engineered with the stainless steel tanks, and, it is quiet. Confusing orders! Look Those 3 buttons On the top, 3 lights in the middle and 3 water outlets! Guess which one is hot and which one is cold and which one is Rome temperature??? We found out buy trying many times.., actually I’m still not sure which one is colder.., Love the bottom loader Looks much better than the top loading water cooler and works perfect! Four Stars So far so good Works great! Just as expected. So far so good! Had it a couple weeks now and it works great! Really nice to have around and to save on bottles of water. Works just as expected. Now I hope we can get at least a few good years out of it! Five Stars I love this produt 0 Stars! If I could give it 0 stars, I would! This thing is a piece of crap. The labels and buttons are backwards. Cleaning it takes an hour and only last 3 days before the water starts tasting gross again and the machine will tell you that the bottle is almost empty, when the bottle is almost completely full. Definitely don't recommend. Huge bummer!!!!! Big time failure. I was very excited when this dispenser was delivered which was going to replace my old one for 3+ years as it had an extra feature of dispensing room temp water too.  I've installed it at 10:45 am this morning and loaded a 5 gal. Bottle. At about 10 PM, the reload indicator started blinking. I was shocked. I did not have a people over, there was only another person at home besides me and there is no way we can consume 5 gal. Of water in less than 12 hours. Neither does the dispenser has a 5 gal. Storage space in it. When I opened the bottle loading unit, I saw water dripping from sup above and the hot water was not being dispensed and neither was the room temp water. Where did the water go? Is still a mystery I'll have to unravel. I have initiated the product return and wouldn't recommend this to any. Hot is very hot, cold is pretty cold. Works great! The only thing that would make this better would be if there were some illumination for night trips to the water cooler. Hot is really hot, cold is pretty cold. Very pleased. damaged the item is damaged. The back piece of the item is bent, the door on the item is also bent, steering to the right. The door doesn't close properly due to the uneven structure and the top part of the door is open while the bottom is closed. Damaged/ dented Received the item slightly damaged. It takes away from an otherwise aesthetically pleasing design. It would be great to receive a new door to replace this one. Five Stars absolutely love it Best money spent Works perfectly and so quiet! Loading the water to the bottom is so much easier, than trying to lift a huge jug to the top. Best money spent. Doesn't work Doesn't work. We bought it for our business in December. We didn't open until February. In January, when we unpacked it, we couldn't get the hot water to heat. We kept trying to follow the manual. No luck. Now, it doesn't cool water either. I got too old to lift the 5 gallon bottles ... I got too old to lift the 5 gallon bottles tot he typical dispenser ..this sure makes it a breeze  changing te bottles !!! Looks great works great! So far this has been great! I wish it was a little taller. Water comes out cold and fast! Have not used any hot water yet but I am sure it works just fine. The pump does not work and the instruction manual is ... The pump does not work and  the instruction manual is poorly written and not clear. I am trying to find a way to return this I like it. It's clean looking I like it.  It's clean looking, and filters are easily accessible.  No more trips to the store for bottle water, and everyone in the family got there preference--HOT, COLD, or RT.  Thanks! Three Stars Hot water disspening button get stuck often. then a month later bought another because I was highly satisfied with the design and bang for the money Bought one unit,  then a month later bought another because I was highly satisfied with the design and bang for the money.  Haven't looked at replacement filters yet, hopefully they're not too expensive. One Star why would this product not come with the required filters. This one that we had for 2 months or less started dripping like crazy from the hot water side I ordered this cooler since our old cooler stopped working. Keep in mind we had it for 13 years. This one that we had for 2 months or less started dripping like crazy from the hot water side. I’m not talking a drop of water every few minutes. I’m talking about drops falling so fast it’s almost a steady leak. I love being able to just slide the water jug in ... I love being able to just slide the water jug in the bottom of this unit! Works beautifully and I find I am drinking a LOT more water! Definitely worth buying. NEEDS DRAIN HOOKUP - WASTES A TON OF WATER Directions were very poor.  You must have this item hooked up to a DRAIN as well as a water source.  We used a bucket to see if we could bypass but It was astounding how much water it wastes through the osmosis system.  It wasted over 10 gallons per day.  When you pay for your water that adds up quickly.  We tried to contact customer service and they never responded.  Also, the hoses and accessories were located inside the machine, which required a screwdriver to remove the back to access them.  This was never stated in the directions.  Would not recommend this product. Update: The company, organize.com, called me back two days after I called them and verified that in fact, for every gallon used, the cooler dumps 4 gallons to clean itself.  This cooler should be outlawed.  What a huge waste of water! Do not buy this. There are no replacement filters. I got screwed On this one. There are no replacenent filters. So, in three months when the filters just throw it away and buy a better product. Great Water dispenser Great find!  The hot water stays hot and the machine is quiet. We use a 5 gallon jug in about 3 days. Having good tasting water (we used to boil then filter our tap water) is such a good thing! I have nothing detracting to say about this purchase. Five Stars It seems to be a great product. The price was reasonable as well. Excellent product. Best thing about it is you don't ... Excellent product.  Best thing about it is you don't have to lift the bottle Five Stars This is beautiful and works amazing! and so far so good! The setup was very easy I received the water cooler about 2 weeks ago, and so far so good!  The setup was very easy.  The hot water works fantastic.  I am hoping it continues to do so.  So far, I am very happy with my purchase. Four Stars It’s good product....and it’s mineral water Reversed indicator lights Great water cooler, quiet, works perfectly, hot and cold temps are great. Reduced by one star because for some odd reason, the temperature indicators on the front are in the opposite order of the buttons that dispense water. I've had several friends come over and had to explain to them that hot water comes out under the snowflake. Simple little design flaw, not super significant, but certainly a head scratcher. Water Temperatures are PERFECT!! Arrived well packaged. Easy set up. Love it! Five Stars Great machine :) I love it Love the bottom- load Brio water dispenser! I really like my new water dispenser! Love the fact that I can load bottles by myself (I can’t lift more than 10#). It cools & heats very well. My only issue with it is the occasional hum/buzz/ vibrations, but then our floors aren’t great, so maybe that’s the problem. All fine All fine Stopped Powering Up @ Day 28 Adjusting rating.  The product worked wonderfully for a couple weeks. Then week three the motor was louder than normal. It is now not powering on at all.  The cooler has been positioned in the same place the entire time. I’m not sure what happened and I am just now getting to the one month mark.  Calling Brio to find out what’s wrong. Love this BRIO I absolutely love this! It's quiet (a huge plus) and delivers ice cold water, room temp and hot water hot enough fort tea. I  don't know how we ever got on without it. I would recommend this to anyone who uses bottled water! the unit is ok on cooling and heating, my ... the unit is ok on cooling and heating,my complaint is that is very noisy, i have it in the kitchen, by night i ear the noise from the compresor in my bedroom. Best purchase ever Very sleek looking. Best purchase ever! Easy to hook up. Okay cut Room temperature button is ice cold; which defeats the purpose of 3 buttons I am very happy with the design and quality of my new Brio ... I am very happy with the design and quality of my new Brio bottom loading water dispenser. It is quiet, easy to load and the water temperatures are perfect. Damaged Item came damaged shipping box not damaged unhappy! Cabinet Door DOES NOT open Very nice,  I thought the stainless part was a cabinet but it is not, that is one of the two things I would change, in the description it says stainless steel cabinet door, which to me means you can open it but this is not the case.  The drip tray is plastic, I would of liked it to be stainless. Other than that performance is great, keeps water nice and cold. Looks great, room temp is cold and a but slow ... Looks great,  room temp is cold and a but slow but over all happy with it. Four Stars everything very well is working perfect  thanks. Five Stars Great water cooler/heater Great for kids and elderly! No need to assemble or making that force to put the water on top, very easy and going for use! Do I really need  hot water didn't think I would use the hot water very much, But its perfect for cup of ramen soup, instant coffee , cup of hot coco, its a lot faster then my Keurig brewer. Easy to replace the water myself Works well in our small office. The hot water makes a little noise when it comes out, but otherwise the unit is totally quiet. Cold water is cold. Easy to replace the water myself. Much easier than pugging a heavy water bottle up. Happy with the purchase. Wish it were a less expensive but if it lasts 10 years like our last unit then I'll be satisfied. Damaged The product arrived damaged The shipping box was fine, but the stainless steel front of the cooler ... I received this unit just today. The shipping box was fine, but the stainless steel front of the cooler has dents all along it. It looks terrible! It looks like someone has kicked it. I am returning it. The unit works fine, but looks awful. I don't want it in my house, especially at this price. Five Stars Great water cooler  quiet and ofisent Great tasting water, but not very clear installation instructions. Installation directions are not very clear.  You must install the the drain tube to a drain or at least put the hose up into the sink when you clean over night (I drilled a hole to the outside and let it spray out there into the bushes).  It's also a pain trying to understand how you are suppsoed to flush the filters before installing them.  The water is excellent, taste is near perfect.  I still can't purchase filters for it yet.  So, I wouldn't purchase this until they clearly sell filters.  They say it will be in June, but if they end up not carrying or selling them, the unit will be useless. Quietly saving money Works great we should have done this sooner, money saver and the hot works as well as the microwave.....very good investment. Recommended. Arrived cracked but I didn't want to go through the trouble of packing it up and waiting for another. Pumps up water very quietly compared to my previous unit. Keeps water very cold and hot efficiently. Recommended. Hot water works great, but no cold so I submitted a return ... Received today and set up only to find that after 6 hours there is no cold water. Hot water works great, but no cold so I submitted a return request. However, after reading several reviews I found that there is a button inside the door on the upper left hand corner that supposedly re-sets the cold unit when you change a bottle. Thus telling the unit is has enough water to start the compressor for cold water. I'll try this and see if it works. TBC...also everyone is right about the icons, they are backwards and VERY confusing! Ok that did not work, still no cold water so returning. Works great, attractive and a good value Works great, attractive and a good value. This replaced a water cooler we had for about 10 years (GE brand) and I shopped around some. This is a well-made product, water flow is very good, cools the water quite well and even has an in-between setting for \"cool\", not cold, water. I enjoy drinking water and now with this in my house I will continue to drink more water. Plus this will get my wife and kids to start drinking more water. Well worth the money. Hot water supply stopped working I purchsed this in late July, in late October the hot water element on the machine stopped working. I am extremely dissatisfied with this machine. Don't buy this product !!!!! Only worked for a couple of months then just stopped working. The hot water spout serves perfect temperature water for making tea or instant oatmeal It works amazingly. The hot water spout serves perfect temperature water for making tea or instant oatmeal. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, especially for the price. If you are researching water dispensers you will know that there are not any for such a reasonable price. And with this inexpensive model you are not sacrificing quality at all. ... and this one has to be one of the better one's i have seen on the internet I did quite a bit of reading looking for a quality water dispenser and this one has to be one of the better one's i have seen on the internet. I have saved so much on not having to buy bottled water anymore since having this and its nice to be able to get hot water with a flick of a switch. Love the bottom loading feature and the water flow is way better than on our old one. Highly recommend! Ok Love it I purchased this water cooler because I didn't like the taste of my tap water and individual bottles ... I purchased this water cooler because I didn't like the taste of my tap water and individual bottles of water were inconvenient. My dispenser delivers cold water quite fast and the amount of time it takes to chill the water is quick too. Now when the family comes over for a get together everyone drinks my water! Overall, I'm very pleased with my dispenser and recommend it to all my friends! Well made, feels solid, and looks attractive. I would highly recommend this to anyone that needs a cooler. It sucks It sucksit sucks Don't buy this First it's really light and seems flimsy. Second, it has three buttons that are not labeled so I had to add my own for customers. Third the room temperature and cold water button both came out cold. Then after only 2-3 months of having it the machine stopped working. I reached out to the company and they sent me a trouble shoot PDF, which I followed but still didn't fix the problem. I followed up with the company again to see if I can get a replacement or something and never got a reply back. it does not pump after a few months I bought this product 4 times in total.  First 2 works perfectly so far.  The 3rd stop pumping water in 1 month and returned.  The 4th has stopped pumping water too, after 3 months. Perfect This is a must for our house and it has worked flawlessly! Cold hot or room temp all the time. Glad I got it! Good product. I bought this one to replace one I gave to my son when he moved out. It is a quality product and I have had zero issues with it. Doesn't last! Absolute garbage! The board burned out just over a year! Of course, after warranty! Disappointed The worst thing I ever bought. The same day I open it was a nightmare. The water will drained by itself. I had to throw it away since I took so long to return it. Waste of money Reduced footprint with this awesome way to get cold filtered water. Stainless steel sleek/polished looks fine in the dining room. Stopped working completely in less than 6 months Since purchase, the room temperature water doesn’t work. Both cold and room temperature  comes out cold.The past month or so now, the light blinks like it is empty and won’t dispense. However, it’s not empty. It’s glitching and now and useless. We’ve had the unit for 5 months or less. Feel like we wasted our money sadly. One Star Unit arrived dented Good for price Great! Only problem is the middle button sometimes sticks so don’t press down too hard Customer service number please ? I bought this may of 2018 and for last two months the refill light is always flashing when it have just replaced the bottle ... I also can not find Customers service number online ... This cooler started buzzing loudly after only a month This cooler started buzzing loudly after only a month.  If you do decide to buy this junk, I advise that you save the box. I couldn't return it because I didn't save the box Works well Works as expected but would like an economy setting to avoid constant heating and cooling costs Don’t buy Bought this cooler 6 months ago and it has already stopped working.  It wont suck the water into the container.  Would not recommend buying this item. Not a good product I bought mine in July, it's stopped working, so disappointed about the product. I guess I will trash it, it's of no use. Broken after 3 months! Broken after only 3 months.  Only cold water comes out of all three slots now.  Enjoyed having three options when all were working.  If I only wanted cold water it would be a 5 star product.  I will call about receiving a replacement & post an update. Would like a replacement Purchased in March of this year and it no longer works. Light keeps flashing red to replace bottle. It seems like the pump had malfunctioned. Not happy at all Really easy and nice!!! Amazing! It looks great. My unit stoped working after only 5 days would not buy! GARBAGE Garbage... Lasted 8 months then leak all over the floor bad seals complete garbage Terrific unit for the price After returning a different unit this Brio was a great replacement.  The unit functions well, is easy to refill, and has worked nicely for us.  It is a bit noisy when refilling the hot or cold water but it only lasts for a few seconds. Looks great in my kitchen with the rest of my stainless ... Looks great in my kitchen with the rest of my stainless steel appliances. although I have to give it 2 stars due to the quality. 2 major things wrong with this product:1) The dispense buttons are confusing/misleading. There are 3 dispensers, the cold water dispenser is on the far right although a picture/icon of a snowflake (for cold water?) is shown on the far left and where the cold water is there is an icon of 2 rectangles? In the middle of the snowflake and rectangles is the sign for hot water which is little flames although the hot water dispenser is actually where the snowflake icon is shown. Not sure if it was just my item or Brio makes their product item all this way but it was upsetting at first, now we are used where the dispensers are.2) The sensor seems to be off from the start. .  after putting in a new 5 gallon and it not being half way empty the sensor will turn red which is signaling us that we are low on water and the machine automatically turns off the cooling setting although still being plugged into outlet. We have to open the bottom and reset the button so the cooling (cold water) is available again.We needed a dispenser that fit our family's lifestyle (look and needs wise) which this half way met our expectations, we are always on the go so I would have returned it but I threw away the box and really don't have the time as it functions but not to the quality it is sold for. If you are looking for looks then sure buy the product but I would not buy again and will be investing in another dispenser when this one stops functioning completely. So smooth and quiet I (foolishly) rented a machine for years, and it was loud and the water came out slowly. This machine is is smooth, quiet, gravity-fed, and has a spike (which, if you have delivery service, means the water doesn't poor out when you flip the bottle over). My only improvements/suggestions would be to (1) add a little LED light to the dispensing area, (2) make the distance between the spouts and the drip tray larger to accommodate water bottles and such, and (3) to place symbols on the buttons to indicate which is hot and tepid (the hot is, I suppose, rather obvious). To be clear, those are NOT complaints. I'm really quite happy with this machine. Lasted a little over 3 months Seems like the motor stopped working and pumping water up. Our second unit is now dead. The first one we exchanged because of loud vibrations from the cooling unit. This one is doing the same, but in addition, it's now broken because it's leaking water out of the top of the unit. Stylish, clean look and function Ive had it for just over a week, and so far am pleased with it overall.  Only nitpicks are in some of its design.  Why the lights for cold and hot are not set up in line with the actual hot and cold spouts is perplexing (they’re opposite). There’s no indicator on the buttons to tell which is cold and which is neutral (which pours fairly cold itself). And finally, the tray holes do not line up with the water, so it splatters on the plastic. Never ever will I own this again I bought Brio Essential Series Bottom Load Hot, Cold & Room Water Cooler Dispenser. Within a month it broke down. When we loaded the dispenser  it went into this constant loop trying to pump the water into the hot and cold water chambers. It fails to pump the water and it show flashing red light to indicate an issue. I contacted customer service they gladly sent me a replacement. 3 months into the replacement item, it run into the same problem. I don't use it heavily, it runs through a 5-gallon water tank a week. In my office the water cooler goes through multiple 5-gallon a day. If this is going to a three month stint, it is not worth it. I will ask for my money back, not sure how that fight will go. I won't own this piece any longer. Stopped Working After 3 Months After three months in my office, with light useage .. it just quit working. No longer will dispense water? Best investment you can make Packed very nicely no damage. Hard time with understanding the instructions but once you figure out what you are doing its a breeze and you will never go back to bottled water again.Thinking on buying a second unit for my garage. Got this as a gift. Got this as a gift because of the issues with the water in our town.  Worked fine for a few months but the last jug of water we put on, it started leaking. We immediately took the jug off and made sure that everything was in place and the plastic ring on the top was secure. Yep. So we put the new jug back on and watched it for a bit.  All was well so we went to bed. Got up the next morning and it had all leaked out over night. The entire 5 gallons had leaked out and ran under our new laminate hard wood floors.  I emailed the company and they were very fast at responding to me and emailed us a shipping label to send it back. They have already shipped us out a new one and a bottom load instead of a top load. Best buy of the year Water is cold and fresh tasting the kids are able to make there own drinks and very easy to setup and use way better thank buying bottles of water. Stopped working after 2 months and company won't return calls Indicator light says \"empty\" when connected to a full bottle of water, will no longer dispense.  Have only had this since mid-late July.  Company won't return calls to fix it as it is under warranty. I love this cooler however am I the only one that ... I love this cooler however am I the only one that has an issue with the pictures of the water temp being backwards?  Not one review mentions it. Left side button with red switch shows cold water.  Middles button below picture shows hot. Right button shows room temp. I’m confused. Which is which? Extremely disappointed! It only lasted me 2 months! It just stopped working. Extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with the product and it’s sellers. I can’t even get a refund !! Failing product Hot water button is sticking after 1.5 months.  Don’t buy I love the unit I love the unit, It is very nice looking! The hot water works fine! But the Cold Water is no Colder then the room Temperature nozzle is! It really up sets me because I really like it and hate the trouble of sending it back! Stopped working after a few months randomly stopped working. customer service refuses to answer.Don't buy Warning!!! After just 3 months, and no warning, my water dispenser just stopped working. The hot water is cold. And now the red light wont turn to green after changing the water bottle. One Star Leaked. Had to return. This broke after one month! Very disappointing. Dispenser broke after one month. Will try contacting company for replacement. Highly recommend Aesthetically appealing. Functional. Quality appliance. Dented jug We would like a new 5 gallon water jug sent to us, free of charge. One of the original two that we purchased arrived to our home dented with a large depression on the bottom side, however, we did not think it would effect the functionality of the jug, so we decided to use it without returning it. After several times of filling it up, we left home one day only to return home to find water leaking everywhere on the floor because the jug had ultimately formed a crack. This mishap not only flooded our kitchen, but also the internal wiring of our $200 water dispenser, rendering it unusable. Please send us a new jug, without any dents. Looking to hear back soon. Not a good buy I bought this product last month it was working g fine and now two days ago it stopped working. I contacted the retailer and I am waiting to see if they respond and give me the warranty to fix or replace it. Until then this will be my review for the product. HORRIBLE, STOPPED WORKING AFTER 3 MONTHS worked great for 3 month and then after the pump does not work. I looked at all the youtube tutorials on how to fix but still broken. I cannot find any website to contact customer support for Brio on google.  complete waste of money Water all over the floor We bought one of these and It would not turn on, so we sent to back and got another.The second one worked fine for a few weeks. then one day we came to the office and found 4 gallons of water on the floor ! not sure what happened but something within the \"guts\" of the unit gave out. and now I have a huge mess on my hands. Had to replace the flooring, and base boards. Very expensive problem. I'm not at all happy with this purchase.and I have to buy a new water cooler! LED Display Incorrect PLUS NO Ambient Water! LED Display INCORRECT!!!! Cold Water indicator light is above the hot water nozel. Hot water indicator light is above Ice Cold Water. There is an indicator light in the middle position, but it dispenses Ice cold water!!! I had to pay to carry it into my office so it will cost more to return than to live with the problem, but if the water fairy would deliver me a new one I will gladly give them this one! Hot water dispenser broken after 6 months It started off like a good purchase, but just 6 months after we bought it, the hot water dispenser just dispenses water that is cold and yellow. We barely used the unit, and I already have to buy a new one. Not happy at all. Do not buy this product. Not working and only bought in April.  No customer service number to call. Doesn’t work Stopped working in two months.  Improperly labeled.  Very good until it just suddenly stopped working. Will never buy this product again It’s super loud ... only chilled water for about 2 months before becoming defective. No longer works to chill water Not working at all Both hot and cold water didn't work at all. Lights were not on and only room temperature water came out. Not worth of the time and effort to unpack, install, return, pack and ship back. Impressed The heating and cooling features are great.  Excellent product. Don’t buy Terrible product leaks everywhere No more overflowing recycling in this house. We go through a lot of bottled water.  We were disgusted by all of our weekly recycling.  We needed a change !We did not want a bottle sitting outside of the unit, and we wanted both hot and cold options.  We also wanted something that was ecstatically nice to look at since we would keep it in the kitchen.  The Brio Essential Series Bottom Load fit met my requirements and was recommended on Prime.  We love it!  The ability to get cold, hot, and room temp water is terrific. The exchange of the bottle in the bottom load is quick and simple.  It is quiet !  We no longer have young children, but the safety button for hot water would be something a family might like.Setup - Simple.  I thought managing the 5 gallon water bottles would be a pain - it is not.  I am still not sure what we will do strategically about on-demand purchase or delivery of the 5 gallon water, but I think we will evaluate that after a month or two.  It's pretty easy to get them in our local grocery store.I would make some small changes and I added a few of these myself.  1.  I put a small white dot on the outside of the unit under each spout.  This way you don't have to always look down and under to make sure your water bottle is under the spout ( avoid spill ).  2.  And this might be a more where we have our unit.  There is not a lot of light, so I added a small battery operated sensor light, so when I put my bottle near the unit the light comes on and I can see the fill point.  3.  I would have more room to sit a reusable water bottle.  Yes, you can remove the catch tray to get more room but that is just tedious.  I tip my bottle and that works ( and the reason for recommendation 1 ).  I did mark 5 stars for value for the money.  I have never owned another unit to compare, but this seems like a good quality unit, so I didn't mind paying what I did.It's been a few weeks and our recycling has dropped dramatically.  A little less plastic in the world is a good thing. Very good Some noise like a refri Unhappy The cold water is not cold at all.....Very dissatisfied Five Stars Works perfect! No complaints not well made looks cheap and is cheap stopped working after 5 months of normal usage would not recommend to purchase DON\"T WASTE YOUR $$ quit working after a few months and no way to return it! was great for 2 months- now broke We loved our cooler for 2 months, even though it is really loud. Now the red refill light is staying  on and it won't suck up water.  Not happy at this point with our purchase :-( I am so satisfied with this purchase I am so satisfied with this purchase. I researched so many water dispensers to try and find the best deal, I finally decided on Brio because it's a brand I've learned to trust. The cold water is very cold and dispenses quickly. The hot water temp is perfect for hot chocolate and even tea. There is a switch in back that turns the hot water off if you don't want to use it. The child safety mechanism on the hot water side is very adult friendly but would be very effective at preventing burns to children. The product arrived in a timely manner in good condition. Set up was very easy. I happy my worries were unfounded and I'm extremely happy with ... I didn't want the old-fashioned upside-down water cooler for my office, so I took a chance on this, but worried in the back of my head that the mechanism that draws the water up would be cheap and it wouldn't last. I happy my worries were unfounded and I'm extremely happy with the purchase. The mechanism that draws the water up is a sturdy long straw that goes to the bottom of the water container and clamps securely to the top of the container. The unit is durable (I accidentally slammed a desk into it while I was moving and absolutely nothing happened to the unit). The cooler is also stylish, quiet, and cranks out ice cold water and hot water in short order. Initial setup takes maybe 3 minutes. I would recommend this product to anyone.PROS:1) Nice looking and extremely simple to use.2) Love the fact the container is hidden.2) Hot water is hot enough to make tea and hot chocolate.3) Empty bottle indicator4) Not noisy5) water flow is way better than on our old one.CONS: No cons This is the best water dispenser that I have come around for my ... This is the best water dispenser that I have come around for my money. I had several water dispensers over the past several years and had not seen a more practical one. This water dispenser has never fail on providing cold or hot water when needed. I really like the feature of the empty bottle indicator, when the red light starts flashing I know the bottle is empty and needs to be changed. I am very satisfied with this water dispenser and hope I don't have to buy another for a long time. Works great! I will recommend this cooler to others. Thanks Brio. Looks great, hot and cold temps both perfect Love this! Especially love the hot feature for my tea and oatmeal love not needing my hubby to load the heavy water up on top like our older model. Warning! Short water pump/sensor life This unit was working fine for about 4 months than began showing signs of pump failure. Now the unit continually indicates an empty bottle even with a full bottle installed. Please reach out to me Brio! Stopped working in less than 5 months. Not good. Received brio water cooler on June 11, 2018 and now on Oct 30, 2018 it stopped working. I refilled the 5 gallon bottle yesterday, inserted probe, and now none of the 3 valves pour any water. Water cooler makes noise after closing bottom door but that's it. Unplugged unit, turned off cold and hot switches. Didnt help. No water pours.  All it does is flash a red icon. Very disappointed. Would like a refund or option for a different model. Five Stars Works fantastic and we are quite pleased Five Stars wasn't well package..but product was perfect Not long lasting We received this as a gift for our anniversary end of July and about a week ago the replace bottle sign came on. We have tried everything! I got On here and found similar reviews! Loved it while it lasted, but I’d find a different brand if I were You! BUY ONE TODAY! Our prior machine started leaking so I had to replace it and wanted to give this a try based on all the bells and whistles in the description and boy, did it deliver.  The ease of use and the ability to have INSTANT hot water and a choice of room temperature or cold drinking water makes it a thousand times better than expected.  It is so simple to put the water in without having to lift heavy bottles.  If you're in the market for a new water cooler you can stop looking and order this one NOW! Happy with purchase! Product has worked great for several months with no complaints! Does not leak, hot/cold water works efficiently, love the child safety for hot water. Happy with purchase! Work as intended small reservoir Don’t Buy Terrible. Would definitely not recommend. Stop working after 2 weeks. I’ve tried everything possible to get it to work. Very disappointed. Bad quality product Broke in 20 days of purchase Keeps water cold Keeps water cold. Easy to use Nothing but trouble The first one came in busted, so we returned it.  The 2nd came in, intact, however, we've had nothing but trouble with it having good suction.  It constantly tells us the water bottle is empty, when it's not, and we have to finesse it multiple times before it'll accept the new water bottle.  Overall just a junky product.  Unfortunately we are now out of our return timeframe for a defective item. Grear dispenser This dispenser has a nice small footprint and looks good as well. I like the fact that I don't need to lift the bottles, I just slide them in. I'm very happy with it. Not happy with the purchase Bought in June 2018 and stopped working after 3 months. Very frustrating with the noise levels. Expensive but not reliable if broke in such a short period Very difficult to install Had to hire a plumber to install.  He had difficulty figuring out the drain.  I looked on You Tube.  Only found an advertisement for this water cooler.  No \"how to\".  I ordered something to hook up to the water faucet so I didn't have to carry water back and forth.  I thought this would fit the bill.  Called (there is no number on the user's Manual.) Downtown Wholesalers is listed on the very bottom of the last page.  No other contact information (e-mail, telephone number, fax, address, etc).  The young man that answered told me if my plumber couldn't figure it out then I needed a new plumber.  This plumber re-piped my whole house but this thing stumped him.  Then this young man offered to send me a \"detailed\" manual of how to install it.  It was the very same manual it came with the water cooler.No phone numbers and only a name to contact on the very bottom of the last page of the User's Manual..  Repairs and After Sales Service gives you no information for contacting the company.  All this makes it difficult to follow through if you have questions.I most certainly will not order again. Awesome! Returned a different brand that I purschased elsewhere because rhe cold water was not cold. This model has ice cold water and the hot water is very hot. Love it! Push buttons are an ease to use. Have it in my kitchen. Don't waste your money It broke after only having it for 3 weeks. Safety design for house with children. Works às expected.  Great design when children around. Lock on hot button but also shut-off switchs high on side of machine  (out of sight), for hot and cold power.  Very happy, and price great . Pump stopped working Purchased 6 July, inoperable 10 September.  Will follow up with Amazon and Brio.Pump does not pull water from full 5 gallon bottle, found water on floor around unit. Its ok Regularly shuts off on its own even when its own but it does keep water cold and hot.  Not really worth the price they charge for it.  Additionallly the hose inside regularly because unsecure.  I spent four hours trying to get the water to suction finally checked all the connections and found that the connection to the pump itself comes off. Smoke on the Water Purchased in June 2018 smoke started pouring out of the back of the machine on Sept 9th. 2018. Great product! A little noisy but good product. Makes a little too much noise, but it works. Junk Worked great for one month then motor/pump stopped functioning. Absolutely ridiculous and inconvenient that I now need to return and replace item after less than 45 days of use. Garbage! Crap!! The hot water button sticks - not good for a waiting room where everyone burns the crap out of themselves. now we keep the hot water button off - which defeats the whole purpose of buying it . :( Hard to find filters replacement Great machine love it. Red refill light continuously flashing Red refill light keeps flashing no matter what I do. Only had this unit since June 2018. Good Product Works well. My office employees use it a lot. One Star The water is not too cold,Was expecting  more coldest Five Stars Works very well, not noisy st all, cold water cold, hot water hot Nice Cooler Its a nice cooler. I do wish it was a little colder.  I havent had a chance to use the hot water side yet. Super cold water works great! Read The Negative Reviews Before Purchasing - Most are consistently the same I bought this product in March of 2018. Worked nicely for six months. Now the red light indicating “change bottle” constantly blinks and won’t pump water. It acts like the water pump can’t gain a suction. Very disappointed. $250 down the drain. Five Stars Very good. Meets my expectations. DO NOT PURCHASE! NOT A GOOD PRODUCT!!! Do not get this water dispenser! It  broke down after just 3 months (I purchased this in May) We have been trying to contact Brio with no successful response for a replacement or our money back the last few weeks. It never really provided cold water and the buttons started getting stuck days before it stopped despising water. Worst product and customer service for a product ever! If I could rate this a 0 I would! Great product. Great for the home. Top notch Water cooler Excellent product. Easy to install and use. Decent price for good water unit. Not sure what other reviewers are saying about unit being noisy. Not an issue here. All good for the last month plus. Good unit. The only feature I wish this had ... Good unit.  The only feature I wish this had was illumination around the area where the water is dispensed.  It is difficult to see at night. Fantastic Love this product! Excellent Cooler! this machine has been great! very quiet - easy to use (basically unpack and plug in). No problems! Not recommended, Cold water doesn't work Was really hoping this would a great product, despite the reviews on saying that the cold water did not work or this and that. But I was wrong. The hot water worked but the cold never got cold. I contacted the seller and their response was that I had to contact amazon because it was fulfilled by amazon. So, I did and I returned the dispenser. Which amazon was very easy to work with on doing so.Had to go buy another one but instead of ordering on amazon, like we do everything else, we went to Lowes and got one. Not as pretty as this one, but it has \"really\" cold water, which is very nice. So suffice to say, I do NOT recommend this product what so ever. Great product!! I like it, my family likes it. Works great!! Good product. Poor instructions. I think this is a great product but once you figure out the procedure it's very simple to install. Product came quick.I didn't realize it that the filters were in the top part of the box. Since these boxes are made to be lifted from the top and the filters are so light I did not realize they were above the top Styrofoam till later. I wasn't sure they were included till much later :( But in that process I realized after searching online that the filters for replacement are yet not available. Another issue I felt was the lack of clear instructions.My issue was that it was a commercial setup and not the usual plastic plumping, otherwise it would have been a breeze for the setup (Definitely easier than the other RO units).One other small issue is the inlet hook up is not the push in type connection and I felt that connector could be replaced with a better one.The water quality is awesome with TDS in the teens for us. It tastes great and I love this unit. I just hope they can come up with cheap filters for it soon.I think the product will get 5 stars once they resolve the above issues. Five Stars Great heavy duty cooling coil, looks great and will pay for it's self in a year from leasing one! Amazing water cooler! It’s awesome! Im getting too old to lift a 5 gallon water bottles. Now I open the door and slide the jug in and put the cap on. I wish I would have gotten this sooner. Could be colder Works great, looks good. The cold water could be a little colder but overall happy with purchase Awesome stainless look Awesome Stainless look product looks great! Product has very cold water and it's not noisy at all! Recommend for the kitchen I purchased 4 coolers from this company all great! 1 for kitchen 1 for garage 1 for office and 1 as a gift!! VERY HAPPY LOVE BRIO I purhased this for my office my employees love it! Great cold water, big space for sports bottle! Conviniant bottom load! And very nice stainless look like the top load version! I purhased the top load for my kitchen Cord is damaged internally and stops going cold randomly It took me awhile to figure out why it stops behaving properly but the cord is short circuiting and has been since I set it up a week after I bought it Quiet, fast, high quality Best water dispenser ever.-Automatic pump is very, very quiet-Chiller nearly silent, and keeps water very cold-Flow rate for dispensing is much higher than other dispensers-Loading/unloading bottles is quick and painless-Pleasant aesthetics, subdued logosThe only improvement I can think of is that they could increase the space under the nozzles so that you could fill larger sized water bottles. Have not seen a water dispenser that has feature yet. Very nice unit We really like how easy it is to load the water bottles. We also really like the 3 different water temps. Not worth it. Man, this thing was great for five months. In the last two weeks though, it constantly shuts off and flashes error lights. We basically have to slam the door on the water compartment closed 10-25 times a day to reset. To be fair I have a toddler but the most he does is steal the spill tray to play with. This thing is fully wack and annoying at this point.I haven't read any reviews with this issue but I'm not in the habit of reading reviews of items I've already bought; I do that before. This thing pooped the bed an astronomical 23 times today so we're going to email the company tomorrow to look for a fix but, being proactive, I'd say save your money. Five months functional isn't worth the price. Not Hot or Cold enough I owned a similar water cooler before purchasing this new one, so I can give an honest comparison. The unit itself is very attractive but lacks a few of the more important items; like a LED night light so you can see where the water is pouring out of (There are times where I miss the water and it ends up pouring on my hand)! The only other thing I was disappointed in was that the cold water is not chilled cold water and the hot water is not steaming hot. Both of which I had on my previous OLD model! I don't know if there is a way to adjust the settings but overall I was a little disappointed. I have to place my hot water from the water cooler, in the microwave to get the water to steam hot for a cup of coffee or tea. I also have to add ice cubes to my glass of water for a \"Chilled\" cold glass of water. Hopefully, the next upgrade will have a light feature and adjustable settings for the waters. Works well met our expectations Does the job heats cools and easy to load as bottom loaded. (5 gallon bottles are heavy) It stopped working practically new Not good bearly bought it in July only 2 months old and it stopped working it keeps lighting empty bottle and its full it won't pick up water Disappointed purchase I’ve used Brio before and had no issues. I was disappointed that it worked for one day and the next day the cooking didn’t work. My water was luke warm. I am returning it and bought a Hamilton beach for cheaper price and works much better n/a Mine stopped dispensing water after 8 months. The red light keeps flashing n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Broke on receipt\" The door hinge was broken when i received it. It was not shipping damage. I think it was a prevoiusly returned item. It was very irritating to get a new item that was broken. It was then hard to get it back in the box. I returned for a refund because the plastic hinge is not a good idea on a bottom loading water dispenser. \"LEAKS LIKE THE OTHERS - but it's an easy fix.\" I buy water in 5 gallon glass jugs that costs $4/gal. So, when reading reviews that various Primo water dispensers have a tendency to leak, I watched mine like a hawk. The water is too expensive to let it go to waste AND I just redid my kitchen floor. Lo and behold, I came home about 4 weeks after purchasing it and there was a puddle on the ground in front of it. I took the casing apart and figured out where the leak was coming from - and why it was happening.The water gets heated in a round metal cylinder covered in Styrofoam. This container sits right at the top center of the parts section and has a cheapo plastic lid that has NO WAY to keep it in place other than the little gripper rings on the side of the lid. In other words, there is no latch or band and it doesn't screw on. As the water heats, the plastic gripper rings start to distort/stretch/etc and they will no longer keep the lid sealed. The lid starts to leak heat (and water) which only makes the problem worse and results in a dispense/heat/leak cycle that is never ending. How you fix it is that you have one person with some impressive upper body strength hold the plastic lid on the cylinder so that it is sealed on all sides. This is harder than it sounds once it gets misshapen. You should have no problems, though, if you do this as soon as you get the item home. Then, you simply duct tape the ever-loving mess out of the lid, securing it tightly to the cylinder. I chose to take thin tape strips and place them in a star pattern across the top, taping the ends to the Styrofoam covering. This has been working well. Do not make the tails on the tape ends too short. They need to wrap fully over the lid and stretch several inches down the cylinder. Do yourself a favor and do this sooner rather than later. This thing WILL leak on you. It is just a matter of time. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Primo water dispenser works great\" Switched from a top load to a bottom load water dispenser. Much quieter and much easier to load. The only draw back so far is that the warning light comes on when water needs changing...doesn't empty the bottle completely. But I just pour the left over amount into a pitcher to put in fridge. \"Don't Waste Any More $$ On A Rental!\" We purchased this unit in September 2015 and have had absolutely no problems. We spent over $700 the past few years renting a cooler from Kentwood. The bottom-loading feature is sweet. I no longer have to wait for my husband to hoist the heavy bottle onto the top of the cooler - I can just slide it in. The hot water is HOT. I use a percolator on the stove for my coffee. It used to take about 15 minutes for the water to boil. When I fill it up with the hot water, it's only about 4-5 minutes. I find that using the push tab to dispense the water is easier than the old hold-down spigot. I don't find it noisy at all. Every once in a while it will rattle and hum, but that's probably due to it not being perfectly level. All in all an excellent purchase and no more rental fees! \"Water cooler\" Very easy to setup and use. Works well with our kitchen setting. Would highly recommend this item to friends and family. \"Great so far\" So far so good. Very quiet & no taste added to water. Can't complain about anything do far. \"Pros and cons\" Easier than lifting and putting water on a top loader is a pro. Con is that the water doesn't seem as cold as a top loader. Four stars due to relief on my back! \"Plug in and use! Easy!\" Water dispenser arrived on time and well packed! Plugged in and loaded water below, started right away and works like a charm! \"This water dispenser is great.\" This water dispenser is nice and style. It matches my stainless appliances. It's awesome not have the large blue water tank at the top and easier to change now.The hot water locking feature is excellent for safety reasons. I glad I purchased this item. \"Not pumping water into the above bottle tank\" I bought this cooler 1 1/2 years ago. It worked fine until recently. Now it does not pump water from the bottom of the bottle under the unit to the top tank. I have tried to reseal the cap on the bottle a dozen times, but no use now. Looking to replace with old style gravity flow type. \"Primo Water Cooler\" I had a Primo Water cooler previously and was very pleased with it therefore, I chose a Primo this time around. The bottom loading is very convenient additionally, the hot water feature if great for instant cereals and hot tea. Very pleased. \"Did not work\" I follow the instruction, the unit connected for 24 hours and did not cool the water.It will be returned today \"We've had this cooler for a few months and love it\" It's easy to load the cooler especially for ladies, not having to lift those big bottles of water to put on top, all you do is just slip it in the bottom. \"Great Cooler\" Great cooler. It's a little noisy when you first plug it in. We found that it quieted down once we leveled out the cooler with a little bit of cardboard. There is a little bit of water left in the bottom of the bottle but this is an issue with all pump coolers. I've used a few different brands of the bottom load coolers and there is always a little bit of water left. I just dump it in my coffee pot reservoir so I don't waste the water. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Almost Perfect\" We purchase this water dispenser to replace one that fed from atop which stopped working. In shortwe love it BUT it only has a cold and hot option not median temp. For the price it should have come with a room temperature option. But again we love it, it just isn't right that their top tier doesn't come with it. n/a Just bought it. Water cold and hot.. love it!!! I bought another one a month ago and I'm taking it back... \"Water cooler\" We like the water cooler but have only had it a couple weeks which is why only a 4 rating. I will review again after a while. I've never had a water cooler and wish it had an easier way to fill a coffee pot/larger container \"Loud, and get the extended warranty\" Bought this to replace 20 month old previous purchase of same model. Get the extended warranty. Hot water started leaking like many other reviews. This one seems louder than last one. Really like bottom load. Nice appearance. Cleaning isn't too much trouble; so, didn't think self cleaning models worth the expense. \"Excellent Water Cooler\" I've read the reviews before deciding to purchase this unit. With some of the review in mind, here are my comments:PRO:Quite Operation. The first few days it was VERY quite. But thereafter it is only slightly louder. Not loud enough to interrupt a conversation - it is quiet as other coolers family members own.Ease of use: It is very easy to change out water and to operate in general.Night Light: The night light helps when you got to have a drink in the middle of the night.CON:No way to lock the cool water - it only has a lock for the hot. I've had little ones press the cold water and had to clean up the resulting mess. [There IS a blue button that APPEARS to be a lock button but it is non-functional.]OVERALL:Very satisfied with the purchase \"Got home, front door was dented\" Open the box before you drive away, would've saved me another trip. Some cushioning at this area in the box would've prevented this. Looked ok, but never got to try it \"4 years\" I purchased this dispenser in the spring of 2014. About a week ago, the cold water started leaking. Yesterday, I put a new 5-gallon in it. Today, it doesn't sense the refill and the water isn't being heated or cooled. I'm completely impressed with the quality appliance I bought from Primo. I will never buy from them again. \"Easy to use\" This dispenser is easy to use and works very well. I wish it was a little quieter, but I am sensitive to sound so it could be just me. \"Good concept, bad design\" Door should be more substanstantial. Nowhere to actually \"open\" it to put the new tank in - have to fiddle with it to get it to open. Rechecked after purchase, and all units are the same. Like the bottom dispense design. \"Have not own this unit long\" I bought this unit after my KitchenAid refrigerator stopped dispensing water and my two attempts at repair didn't solve the issue. I opted for the bottom loader, since my wife is 5'6\" and 110 lbs. I figured this would make it easier for her and my step-daughter who lives with us.Pros -Easy to setupEasy to load bottle waterLike the hot and cold water features, really hadn't thought about using hot water but my daughter uses it for teaQuietCons -Cold water isn't chilled but rather slightly below room temperatureHot water was not consistently available and the light for heating was not onThe design of the reservoir could be an issue, had to tape the lid shut as it was ajar after only 3 days use. \"Lovin' it\" Looks good in our home. Love that you don't have to look st the bottle sitting on the top. Easy to install and load \"Primo Water Cooler, Upgrade from Previous Model\" This purchase was to replace a previous Primo Water Cooler, a top load model. So far, I have noticed at least a couple of benefits with the upgraded model: As my water cooler sits atop a kitchen counter, loading a fresh water bottle entailed using a step-stool to crawl atop the kitchen counter, while holding the 35 pound water bottle. The newer bottom-loading model eliminates the need to leave the kitchen floor, and the cooler can stay in place while I replace the bottle. Additionally, this newer model is actuated by holding a glass against the levers on the front, so that a glass can be filled with water by using just one hand (the older model required two hands). \"Avoid at all cost\" Bought and worked good for 5 weeks now the cold water will not dispense.What a waste of moneyDO NOT BUY n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"A good unit!\" This unit is a house friendly very decent look, easy to operate, easy to load especially if you bought a refill 5gallons like me. The reason I wrote this review is I learned a lesson how to take care of this unit, first of all I will recommend to buy a 2yrs warrantty for $ 24 something to total of 3 yrs warranty including your 1 yr factory warranty so you have a peace of mind just like what I did to make story short my unit broke 20 days before my warranty expire and the lowes send me a merchandise card with the total amount of the unit.Tips: mostly the first thing to brake in a buttom load unit is the pump, so if the redlight is flashing don't wait to long, replace right away or turn it off or else the pump will be damage! thanks i hope this will help! \"i'm not sure about it yet, bad taste ran 9 gal.H20\" I ordered online, when I received from UPS it was busted, it looked like they just threw it around not caring what was in the box. took it to a Lowe's store for an exchange. This product needs water system flushed out before being boxed up to be shipped. Needs to have a on-off switch to shut pump off. Water flow is good, Temps are good, We like the paddle controls to get our water. Looks like the newer ones are push button. \"AWESOME!!!\" Just bought today!! Cold water is ice cold!!! Hot water is hot!! Easy to put together. I bought the warranty just in case. I am very pleased!! \"electrical usage ???\" I have this cooler for a year and it works good , handy the bodem fill for the bottles .Electrical use I have my doubts , I can't find in the watt's in the specifications and this thing is zooming almost the whole , not that we use it a lot 7 to 8 gallons a week and no hot water . \"Really like. Nice style and works well.\" Great customer service as usual. Really like the fact that I can get a military discount. Keeps me coming back. Thanks Lowe's ..... \"Much too noisey\" Have had it almost a year to the day, seems like it gets louder every week. Pump now chatters quite a bit when pulling from bottle. Thank goodness I bought a service plan, this is a lousy dispenser. \"It's a Leaker!\" Purchased and installed on a Monday - 5/21/18. Leaking by Friday - 5/25/18. PRIMO indeed! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Stick with the old style\" After having this bottom loader for a few weeks, I wish I kept the old style with top loading water bottle. Don't get me wrong this works flawlessly however you cannot see how water is left in the cooler even if the low level light is on. You don't know how many ounces are actually left, and bending over to put the cap on. You are still required to lift the bottle a bit anyways before you can slide it into the cooler it seems more difficult than picking it and loading it from the top. \"LOVE THIS WATER DISPENSER\" i bought this water dispenser like 2 months ago i had to give a review and a rate of 5 stars this thing is awesome the water is cold and the hot water is very hot and it has a child safety but speaking cold water its gets cold love it i would recommend this product either a family member or a friend. \"Avoid this product\" We purchased this with an extended protection plan. It's a good thing we got the extended protection plan! The first cooler we bought didn't get the water very cold. Then the pump in it died shortly after purchase. I called the company and my extended protection plan got me a replacement cooler. The second cooler worked okay for about 6 months. It is currently on brink of death just a little more than 1 year after purchase. It no longer cools water and it vibrates very bad when dispensing. Poor quality! Avoid this product! \"Garbage product\" Had this for maybe about a year before it started leaking watched their YouTube videos and did as they instructed in attempt to fix it a month later it leaks again from a different spot made the decision to replace it with a different brand and I was emptying the overflow trap below the spouts it leaks scalding water on my hand as if giving a final screw you \"Great\" I have had this dispenser for about 3years never had a problem does not stick out like a sore thumb I love it no leaking or anything n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Replacement for 15 yr old that went belly up\" I love the look of this unit and the colors match the current kitchen. Being able to place the bottle under instead of over and upside down allows my wife to fill unit without my help, love it. Miss the frig. my old unit had, but. Not having the bottle on top also allows for decorations there. Unit seems to be a little noisy when cooling water. \"Water Dispenser\" Excellent product, easy to set-up and load 5 gallon water bottles. My 12 year old daughter set it up. \"Not impressed\" I bought a new water cooler to replace one that died. It was Primo's bottom loader vs the old top loader. When i got it home and set it up, it started leaking all over my kitchen. I called technical support and the woman said it needed to be returned because it was defective. We could've just gotten a lemon. I ended up returning it the next day and exchanged it for Primo's top loader and it's working fine. \"Great Purchase!\" Great product and very quiet. This is my 2nd bottom loading water cooler and this one is better than the first. I have only had for a week, but everything is working great so far! \"A little noisy and spills\" I like this product because I have small children and I would not be comfortable with the heavy 5 gallon water jug on top. The cons to this water filter are that it's about as loud as having another refrigerator in the house. The noise is not constant but turns on and off as the water gets pumped up. That's the trade off for not having to lift the heavy jugs. The hot water dispenser gets stuck sometimes. So after you pull away the hot water continues to flow and spills everywhere and you could easily burn yourself. You have to press the red button to make it stop flowing. It would be nice if the cold water dispenser also had child safety that could be turned on or off as needed. \"LOUD!!!\" I had to give this one away--the cooling function is incredibly loud. Going to try the Pro and see if it's any better. \"Primo water cooler\" Works great, nice not having to lug the bottle up to the top, just slide it in and it works! \"Best water cooler ever!\" After having top loading water coolers over the years, they always flooded the kitchen without warning after a yr of use. We found this bottom loading one, which is easier than flipping the bottle & when it's time to replace, we won't have a flood. It looks so classy in our kitchen, it's so easy to load the bottle underneath, it's quiet, and the levers work faster than our old one that took forever to fill a glass. It has a safety feature on the hot water so it's great when kids are around. We are so happy with this purchase--highly recommend this water cooler! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"So far so good.\" I have owned this product for about a week - so far it works well - cold is cold and the hot is very hot - the water spickets are a bit to low but his I can live with, it is nice that it can take both three gallons and five gallons of water. The night light is a good feature but it is not very bright. The last water cooler lasted about ten years, this cooler lasted about twelve years, only time will tell. It is very nice that the bottle is out of sight on the bottom of the unit. I did take the extended guarantee from Lowe's. Hope I never need to use the extended guarantee, the cost for another two years is only $ 24.50. As I said so far so good - it also looks very nice. I do not use Primo water, buy from a local water company. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Started off good\" My wife and i purchased 1 of these units 4 weeks ago from our local Lowe's. When we got it home i unpacked the unit installed a 5 gallon Primo water bottle plugged it in and turned it on. The thing worked great for exactly 2 weeks then 1 morning i went to get a glass of water and absolutely nothing came out of either spigot. So to Primos website i went to troubleshoot. After watching the video 3 different times i tried all their remedies none of which worked. Slightly irritated i called their customer service and was transferred to a polite woman who walked me thru all their steps a second time. After verifying the unit wouldn't work she recorded the serial number and told me they would ship me another water dispenser from California and i would have it in 7 days and it would have a new warranty. My new unit arrived this Wednesday, i just unpacked and hooked it up tonight it works great at this time and only time will tell. Anyway while i was awaiting the delivery of the replacement cooler i searched the web and found that this unit is known to have pump issues and that they offer no pump replacement just entire unit replacement. If i could do it over again i would have just bought another top load cooler as my 6yr old top load cooler works just fine but didnt have a hot water options. \"Better than expected\" This was not the specific model that I had in mind after my old Primo bottom loader went out on me after 4 years but I'm glad that I made this purchase. Very quiet operation and looks good in the kitchen. Water is nice and cool within minutes after hook up. I like the one handed operation. On other models you need two hands to dispense water (one hand to press button and other to hold glass). No regrets with this purchase. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"worst water cooler ever made\" this water cooler leaked from every possible area imaginable,complete junk,now the inconvenience of returning it to lower may be just as bad. \"Perfect for us\" This cooler is so easy to use. I love that we can have hot water or room temp, plus the always cold option. It is so easy to load. We should have gotten this sooner. Great value and excellent product \"Purchased for our shop\" Only have had a few days that is why I gave it a 3 for quality, but so far it is working great. I like not having to lift the bottle way up to put on top of the cooler. I hope we get good service out of it but if not I purchase the warranty. \"Promo water cooler\" Water is so much better then plastic bottle water. this water cooler looks nice, works well. we love it! \"Easy to use and install!\" Loved that it loads from the bottom, so easy to use and change out the bottles. It isn't loud either, nor does it generate heat in the area. \"Primo Water Cooler\" I have a two year old unit in my home in Winter Haven. I recently purchased a Hamilton Beach for my home in Boca. Big mistake! The unit was noisy, continually clogged the water dispenser pipe and in general an inferior product to the Primo. Donated the Hamilton Beach and bought another Primo. Now we are quietly well hydrated at both our homes. \"Worked great when it worked\" Purchased this from Lowes back in April 2017. The dispenser never leaked and worked fine until May 2018 when the hot water heater stopped working. The warranty on this product is only 1 year and as only clean, bottled water was ever run through it I would have expected the heater to work for many years. Unfortunately it broke only 2 weeks out of warranty so I am stuck with it. The cold water side still works but for $179 I would expect a longer lasting life. \"Great Hydration Station\" As a family we drink a lot of water and our neighborhood recently had our water pipes updated so we were relying on bottled water all summer. I wish we would have gotten this sooner to reduce as much waste(we still recycled) as possible. The only thing about the product that I didn't like is that we couldn't lock the cold water also. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"pleased so far...\" Just got this home and running. FYI, item #577843 is the new version of item #186795, which has 74 reviews.It's nice to just slide the bottle into the cabinet from the floor without having to lift it. It sits solidly on the floor and doesn't feel like it is in danger of tipping over. To dispense cold water, you simply push back on the lever. To dispense hot water, you have to push in the red button on the front then push back on the lever. The motor is very loud when you first plug it in but is virtually silent once you put the plunger into the bottle of water. Our water delivery service bottles have a cap with a stopper in it to help prevent spills when flipping it over. In order to use them in this dispenser, you have to completely remove the cap before inserting the probe/plunger. The cold water flows much more quickly than the hot water. The only \"problem\" so far is how wide the hinged side of the cabinet is. It hinges on your left as you are facing and it cannot be against a wall because it needs too much space to swing open. I am concerned about the negative reviews of the manufacturer's customer service, but I have to take the chance. There are not many dispenser choices under the $200 mark. Sorry I had to replace my 8 year old dispenser but I hope this one lasts just as long. \"Love the system!!\" Bought this for my mother so she wouldn't have to keep waiting on me to load a new water bottle. The ability to just slide the new bottle in without lifting is a win-win for everyone!! \"Awesome Buy\" So I purchased my unit three weeks ago. So far, so good. The Cold water is nice and cold and the Hot water is Hot. The night light is a bonus because no need to turn on kitchen lights to get a drink of water. It's fairly quiet as well. Goes great with my kitchen decor too. Thanks \"LOVE this!\" Great price, but works great. quiet operation. Just what I needed for my home office. I don't think I've ever had this much intake of water in my life. A great way to get me to drink more! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Worked for a Month\" This cooler worked great for three months then it stopped working. I unplugged it and tried to reset it to no avail. I even went on YouTube and watched tutorials on how to reset it; still no luck. Bottom line - this is a piece of crap. Avoid it. My Grandma always said you get what you pay for. She was right. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"LOVED IT...until the pump went out\" I purchased this water cooler in January of 2017 and loved it until August of 2018 when the pump went out and it stopped dispensing water. Thought it would be an easy fix but I was wrong. Searched the internet and contacted Primo only to find that you can not get a small replacement pump and have to buy a new unit. Disappointed...for the cost buying cases of bottled water would have been cheaper. \"I brought the first model of the primo\" I brought the first bottom load primo model two of them at Lowe's now I have had them for two years I'm a contractor and I carry one of them around from job to job when the unit is empty the heater and cooler will continue to stay on their not automatic cut off switch, so I was told by lowes associate when the unit is empty cut the heater of immediately which is the red glowing switch, reason is the diaphragm cap will heat up loose it shape then unit will leak so I paid attention to what the associate told me and I never had one issue for 2 year and both of them are used around the clock.. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Water Cooler\" Not only is this a great product but the staff was helpful and kind about helping with this purchase. I will be making all other buys at Lowe's now! \"Very happy with this water cooler!\" Easy to load the 5 gallon container. The water heats & cools fast and I like the flat top - provides a place for the plastic glasses! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Not a high rise\" Just like everything now adays, plastic is the main substance used for construction. with this unit, one does not have to strain to get the bottle up on top of the dispenser. Also there is no weight sitting on top of the plastic weighing it down to weaken it to create cracks.With the bottle hidden you have to open the door ocassionaly to see the amount of water in the bottle to be prepared for it getting emptied. \"Hot has too wide of range.\" The dispenser works very well but the hot has a temp range that it could be. It isn't always as hot as I would like it to be. Would be nice to have a control on hot temp. \"Totally worth it\" I'm not a big fan of tap water and making the wife flip a 5 gallon tank upside down wasn't happening. Bottom load would have to be it. Price was fair and there really wasn't anything special putting it together. The wife could have bought it, lifted it, and installed it herself. The water tank is heavier than this machine :) Could have used a button for straight water (not hot or cold), but whatever... I like it. \"Appealing and Useful\" Water cooler in sleek color. Jug is tucked away behind the door. Easy to operate. Very nice and practical. Very reasonable price also. \"Works great!\" Hot and Cold water. Found that it kept trying to load water from bottle, discovered the hose at the pump was not fully connected. Now works! n/a The plastic dispenser levers are the only thing I don't like about it! \"Nice Water Cooler!\" Easy set-up, simple to use - nice that the water jug is in the base and we don't have to lift to change. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Looks great, breaks quickly\" Bought a model 601144 on April 25, 2018. It looked great and chilled well. This morning, the pump became very noisy and will not suck. And when I tilted the dispenser a little bit to move it away from the wall, a quarter cup of rusty water leaked onto the floor. Not even going to make a warranty claim -- don't want the thing (or its buddies) in my house. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Water cooler works well and looks good.\" We have had this for a couple of weeks, and it is working very well. Cold water is definitely cold enough and the hot water is good enough to make tea. No visible water bottle is also a plus. \"Cold and Hot Water Cooler is great!\" Hot water heats up instantly while holding the red button as if it was heated up on the stove or in the microwave. Being able to load the water in the bottom of the machine is also a great feature, you don't have to see the water on top of the machine. The machine is a little loud at times, but the loudness doesn't last long it does quiet down. Overall it's a great cooler. Would have given it five stars, took a star away for the loudness of the cooler. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Returning After 3 Days\" I bought this water cooler for my wife 3 days ago. We have a well and my wife doesnt like the taste of the water. I bought the bottom load so she never had to lift the heavy bottles and to keep water from sloshing out when loading the top ones. We have not gotten any water out of the cooler, except when installing it and making sure it worked. We get up this morning and see water on the floor around the cooler. I open up the door and the 5 gallon water bottle is completely empty. We find the carpet in the room next to the room soaked, as well as standing water in the pantry, right next to where the cooler was placed. I managed to get less than a gallon of water out of the cooler, which means i have over 4 gallons of water in my carpet and under my kitchen floor. Not very happy that i have had this cooler 3 days. Total piece of junk that is being returned as soon as i get off work, and wont be replacing it! \"Great cooler\" I love this cooler. Initially it took a while to heat and cool the water but it is pretty fast now. \"Primo Water (heater) Cooler\" We are really enjoying this product. My husband loves just getting up and the using it for hot coffee water. We both enjoy everything about it. \"Primo Perfection\" Absolutely love this product so easy to set up and water is cooled within minutes \"Cool water, SO LOUD, endless noise\" Convenient bottom fill but if you enjoy the quiet of a solitary early morning breakfast do not buy this unit. The unit makes such a racket that it has destroyed the peace and quiet if iut lovely kitchen. \"Great water dispenser\" Love that I no longer have to lift the water bottle onto the cooler. Now, I just have to slide in place, put the pump cap on and it's good to go. \"no heavy lifting\" Replaced my older primo water cooler. Much better with water bottle on bottom instead of top loading. Now my wife can change bottle without heavy lifting and spilling water n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Junk\" Purchased from Lowes in July. Stopped working in September. So $200 for two months equals $1200 per year for cold water. What a bargain. Currently does a great job dispensing tepid water. Tried everything in the manual to troubleshoot. No luck. Support is only available during working hours. If I quit my job I can call Support and then perhaps they can help me get this unit to dispense cold water. \"Door dented out of the box,but works great..so far\" Works well so far and set-up is a breeze, I like the idea of being able to just slide the bottle in the bottom instead of lifting them on top but even so there will be some spillage when you stick the water probe in the bottle because the water bottles are filled to the top but that is no biggie. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because when I unpacked it the bottom door was dented and all banged up to the point that I can barely open the door to get the bottle in, I checked Primo's website and they have replacement door assemblies instead of returning to Lowes since the closest one is 45 minutes away I will just go through Primo instead of the hassle of running back to Lowes. The cold water works great, I didn't use the hot water I have that turned off. I hope it holds up to everyday use I have my fingers crossed, I already have 1 strike for the dented door, if it doesn't last long, this will be my first and last from Primo \"Nice water dispenser\" Its nice and I like that I don't have to tip the bottle of water upside down. I don't like how it leaves a little bit of water in the cooler once the red light flashes letting me know its time to replace it with a new bottle. \"water dispenser\" Full operation was quick and easy and the bottom load feature makes it so much easier \"Worked good for awhile\" Bought the Model 900133 bottom loader back in February 2013. Worked great for the first year and a half. Then the cooler pump was so loud cooling the water we just shut it off. Within the last few months the red light came on when the jug was still half full. Did some trouble shooting and adjusted the hoses. Primo gives you very little to go by for trouble shooting. Then within the past week the pump slowly started to fail then broke. Looked up on line for a new pump and found out I could get the same one for $152.00. There were a few other cheaper ones different design but did not have the same specs. For how long it lasted the average cost ended up $5.70 per month so I guess it is not to bad deal but should have lasted longer for only two people using it. I am going back to the top loader and decided to forget about the pump. I was a nice feature but with the noise and unreliable pump it will pay to go back to the top. \"Water cooler Omni\" I like nite light the hot water the water is not as cold as I would like it to be that's the only thing wrong,the size and height is great nice and compact \"Lowe's BAD on a BAD Product\" We purchased one of these Black/SS Bottom-Loading Cold and Hot Water Cooler ENERGY STAR water coolers. Within a month or two it started leaking. Primo sent us a replacement. Within a couple of weeks, that one started leaking. Again, a replacement. Within a few days that one started leaking.Lowe's was horrible. They wouldn't stand behind their sale. They just referred us to the manufacturer. I won't buy from Lowe's again for our business or for myselfThe manufacturer asked us to perform several troubleshooting steps, but can only send us another replacement. Do they REALLY think we want another one? They offered a slightly different model, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with anything from them.I'd stay away from Lowe's and from Primo. Get something else. n/a Very pleased with the Primo water cooler,I purchased on November 24 th, its very quite and efficient, would recommend this product to family and friends. \"Water Cooler\" The water cooler was easy to install and friendly priced. Our family enjoy it and use it frequently. \"Primo Water Cooler\" We have purchased Primo/Black Bottom Loading Cold and Hot Water Cooler Energy Star. Have had it a Few months and it works Great. Hot is Hot and Cold is Cold or you can drink not so cold water. Love the night light and easy bottom loading.c n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"So-so\" I have a love hate relationship with this water cooler. I love how it's bottom loading and the simplicity of it, but there is one thing I hate about it! With my old water cooler, my water was ALWAYS cold. Even when the water jug was empty, the water in the cooler remained cold. With this water cooler, the second the bottle is empty, it stops cooling the water. I'm not sure how much water is held in the cooler (I know it's a minimum of 30 oz. because I'm able to fill up my 30 oz tumbler even when the water jug is empty), but it comes out room temperature! It's really irritating because I don't realize that my bottle is empty and by the time it blinks indicating that the bottle is empty, my cooler water is no longer cool. If you change out the bottle immediately, this won't be an issue for you. But it's an issue for me. I wouldn't buy this cooler again. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Water dispenser\" It looks and feels sturdy. Nice to look at. Switching bottles is super easy. Buy protection plan. Mine stopped cooling after a couple of months. I purchased it again because I am done with water bottles. \"Primo bottom loading hot/cold water dispenser\" Easy to unpack, very quiet unit, only improvement I would request is a taller unit so I don't need to bend over to use. You would figure engineers would think of that sort of thing it's a common problem among these units because I've now owned 3 of them. \"Poor Quality product\" Stay away from this product. Bought this product and after 8 months coldwater pump when out and began to vibrating really loud when using hot water downpour. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"More than adaquate\" A water cooler is a simple thing. This one is straight forward but with some nice additions for a base model. It is capable of both cooling and heating water, but if you don't use one (for me I don't need hot water) you can switch that function off to conserve a little electricity. The night light above the dispenser is also a great option. \"Excellent product that satisfies our demands.\" Always able to find what we need and someone is ready to assist when help is needed. \"Good unit at a fair price\" This is the third water cooler I purchased in the last month.The first one from another store arrived in pieces,the second one was a $250 bottom loader, the compressor rattled when it shut down and the pump made noise every time it ran.Several bottom loaders have the same complaint.I went back to what I had for 8 years with no issue a top loader that wasnt the cheapest but had the features I wanted for our office.I had the Primo cooler for a couple weeks now and its great.Cold water is ice cold and hot water is perfect.I dont hear it run either its very quite.I am very happy with this unit. \"DO NOT BUY!\" We bought our first cooler in May of last year. Never having one before, we weren't sure what was normal and what was not. Ours would make a loud knocking/boiling sound periodically. After hearing from a friend that it was not normal, I called Primo and they said they would send me a new one, no questions asked. They sent me another one and within a week this one is getting progressively louder. I can no longer return it to Lowe's, and I really don't want another Primo one. Save yourself a headache and go with another brand. \"No water on hot side so can't plug it in\" Per the instructions, I can not plug the unit in because it says NOT to plug the unit in until water will dispense from hot side. I've followed the instructions about shaking slightly and tapping the bottle. I've re-seated the bottle. Water will come out the cold side but not the hot side. I went to Primo's site but could not get my question answered. I just bought it yesterday and tried to set it up today. \"Nice product for the price\" This is our fourth water cooler. This one is working well for the first month. Water is cold, however there is no thermostat to control how cold- no setting at all for the cold. You can turn on/off the hot. My only concern is the plastic 'paddles' that you push against to dispense the water. It is very convenient (vs holding in a button), but, just wondering how long they will last without breaking. Hopefully it is a replaceable part. Also, a $50 ComEd Electric Co rebate was helpful in the purchase. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"2 years and stop cooling\" After 2 years my water cooler stopped cooling. I reviewed the videos an d contacted manufacture. No luck, unplugged waited an, still not cooling. To make me feel better they offered to sale me a new cooler for $95? No thanks, it will break in 2 years. I'll buy from someone else. \"To good to be true\" It started off nice but after about ten 5 gallon bottles it started to leak from the top. which means a big 5 gallon puddle on your floor. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"2 year product\" Like all the other reviews I read... Mine too quit working at the 2 year mark. Compressor is shot! I thought I'd just buy again and get the extended warranty but they only offer a 2 year warranty at the store so that's useless. Time to find another manufacturer! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"My first water dispenser I have ever bought and...\" I LOVE IT! Not using a traditional water jug of 3 or 5 gallons, but using a water filtering system that accepts ordinary tap water and filters it. What I get is purified, filtered tap water and extra $ in my wallet from not having to buy bottled water anymore! The dispenser is great. I do like the paddle dispensers, but the hot water at times sticks, causing overflow.Another reviewer mentioned the sharing of germs with the paddle design, and I can see it in an office setting. But this is for my residence, so really not a concern for me at this point.Temps are excellent; cold water is refreshing, and hot water is piping hot. Minimal background noise from compressor, and i like to removable drip tray feature, also.Overall, a great product that serves its purpose, just slightly irritated with the sticking of the hot water paddle, thus the 4 star rating. The next thing to be determined is longevity, which I hope to get, at the least, 2 years out of this water dispenser. For the price, a great water dispenser. n/a Not enough hot water and sits too low to the ground. We did not like it at all. \"water cooler\" Exactly what I needed. Hot or cold water immediately when I want it. \"Wish I'd gotten One Sooner!\" I've only had the cooler a few weeks, but so far it's great!! I had put off getting one for over a year, simply because I hadn't gotten around to it. Now I wish I'd gotten one sooner!!!It would be nice if it had a room temperature function (I've put my pets on bottled water too!), but using both the hot and cold together, accomplishes the same thing :)My only complaint if I had one, is I wish there was a way to disable the safety button on the hot side. I realize it's to prevent children from accidentally scalding themselves, but wish it could be disabled for those of us who will never have children near it. \"Great water dispenser!\" We have owned this dispenser for years and it has been 100% reliable! It is easy to use, although it takes some balance and muscles to replace a 5 gallon jug. \"I was nervous too\" This is actually a good buy. I was nervous but went ahead on it and am glad for it. You will be too. \"leaks\" It started off nice but after about 6 months it started to leak from the top. $170 wasted and now I have to pay just to drop it off at the dump... \"Leaking after 2 days\" We purchased a primo water cooler on Friday, and two days later on Sunday, the hot side of the cooler has a continuous leak. The reviews on this product mention the leaking issue. Why the company has not corrected the problem is surprising. Why Lowes continues to carry the defective product leaves me speechless. \"Primo SS Water Cooler 4 stars\" We have had it a full week now and it's working great. The water is cold and hot when turned on from the back. The one nice surprise was a night light built in. Didn't know that. It's low enough that my wife who is 5'3\" can put the 5 gallon Bottle on this unit with no issues. The only Real Negative thing we have to say about this unit is it's really loud when the unit is attempting to cool the water. We just turned the cool unit part off since we use ice in our water anyways. Problem solved. In all fairness we do have hardwood floors so it tends to make all noises in our home louder. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Good buy\" Read many reviews before purchasing and were not good but the reviews were a couple years old referring to leakage and problems with dispense handles but 2016 of June maybe manufacturing problems were corrected or operator error. Because cooler is designed for the water bottles that have the spill proof insert in bottle cap because you're not supposed to peel the cap off just the protective plastic sheeting that exposes the self piercing part of the bottle cap. This cooler has the spigot in it that when put bottle on top it will pierce the opening in it therefore controlling water flow without spills or leakage \"Wish I could love it...\" I love the look of this cooler and was so excited it would be great. Unfortunately, every bottle we put on ends up leaking and we find a huge mess in the kitchen. I don't know why. Very disappointed and we will be returning it. \"Leaked first night\" I was hoping to love this water cooler, but unfortunately it slowly leaked from the cool dispenser all through the night, the first night it was set up. I will return it and try it again. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"So far so good\" Best thing, it has an on off switch for hot/cold/light cause I really only use the cold water setting. Not a drawback for me because I have two little ones but it is short and I am tall. The filler nozzle is 24\" from the floor. Great for kids, we drink lots of water. It's quiet and don't have to worry about the pump going out on the bottom feeders. \"good quality top loading water cooler\" found this at a local lowes and decided to get it because of the nice black color and the paddle style tabs for dispensing the water. read bad things about the button style dispensers leaking so figured this is probably a newer design and being that not EVERY lowes store has this I figured it must be fairly new and they're trying to sell out the old style stock before refreshing all stores with this model. considering it is the same price as the other black top loader it was a very easy decision.came home, unpacked (easy), put new fresh water bottle on top (unit punctures when you load it), plug in (cord is a very good length so you should have no issue with placement)), turn on cold &/or hot switches in back, dispense a cup or two of water to flush out the lines as recommended in the manual, wait an hour or 2 for the water to reach temp, and finally, enjoy! wife does like the taste and loves the convenience of cold water without having to open the fridge constantly grabbing bottles or the brita pitcher (which doesn't get rid of all tastes from tap water)save yourself some money and invest in one of these, don't bother with the bottom load models unless you absolutely have trouble lowering your arm to fill up your water.almost time to buy a replacement bottle and keep one in the basement as a spare so I don't have to run to the store immediately after running out. don't forget to turn off your switches or just unplug the unit when removing empty water bottles. don't want any of the coils to get damaged!register this on primo website for warranty coverage!! \"Not what I needed for\" Very nice looking but it will not fit water filtering bottles. Not paying for filtered water! n/a Purchased two for family members and they both lovd it. \"Primo\" Easy installation. Appreciate the ability to have both hot and cold water. Also, looking forward to not having to buy cases of bottled water and having to recycle. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Great Product!\" Purchased a month ago has been great so far! Cold and hot water on demand. Quiet machine no louder than the fridge. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Primo Black Water Cooler\" Very good cooler.I'll recommend this product to family and friend. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Great water coolers.\" Bought two of these for our office. Cold refreshing water. Everyone at the office enjoys them. Hot water works well for oatmeal and tea. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Primo Water Cooler\" Excellent hot and cold water whenever you want it. Easy to install, easy to change bottles. \"Great Water Cooler!\" Needed to replace a water cooler that was freezing up on me. researched many and settled on this one. I am not sorry I did! It keeps water very cold and when hot spigot is used, it is certainly hot enough! \"Primco top loading hot & cold water cooler\" Reasonable price.Very cold water.I recommend this product \"Compact\" Not too cumbersome. Fits in small spaces Water is cold \"Water Cooler\" I am thinking about returning it, The cooler just doesn't get the water cold..... \"Very please with this water cooler\" Moved 'down' from a bottom bottle fed unit that looked 'cleaner' but was loud and continuously had pressure issues. Sure I have to lift the bottle to the top but the gravity fed mechanism works much better, no dispensing issues or loud grinding pump sounds. Heats and cools the water with no issues.K.I.S.S. prevails over a cleaner looking unit. \"So far so good\" We use this at my work and it been doing well for consistsnt usage for the last month or so n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a So far, it works as advertised and doesn't take up a lot of space in my little kitchen. \"BEWARE - Push paddles to get the water\" I bought this unit for our office and it didn't even dawn on me that this unit uses \"push paddles\" to fill/refill your cup. Although the unit seems to be made fairly well and got good reviews, I can't get over the fact that every time someone refills their cup, they are spreading germs onto the same paddle that I will use to fill up my cup and vice versa. In today's day and age of germs everywhere, this is a poor, poor design.I passed on the unit below this one because it got bad reviews but at least that one uses buttons up top to fill your bottle/cup and you don't actually push your cup against a paddle as everyone else has before you. Had I realized this beforehand I would not have purchased this unit. \"This one works\" After replacing an older Primo cooler with another Primo like the first, it leaked just like the first one. This more expensive one seems to be working just fine. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Good Good\" It is a nice water dispenser. The black and stainless looks sharp in my apartment. I do wish the cold was colder. I will give you a heads up though... the hot is very hot. I temped mine at about 180 F. I can brew coffee and make ramen very quickly. I don't have kids so this isn't an issue for me. There is a two step process to get hot water but any smart kid could figure it out. I'm just giving you a heads up. IF you boil water on the stove and then remove it for about five minutes estimate that is 180 F. I've seen people claim that theirs only reaches about 100 F. I found this to be incorrect. As I said I checked mine with a food probe and an infrared thermometer. Great water cooler though. \"Water dispenser\" Great water dispenser would recommend it to friends and family \"poor design\" The push paddles were hard to use. We reuse our small water bottles. The paddle caused a lot of spilled water. Also could not fill a 1 gallon jug. We ended up keeping our old dispenser and returning this one. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Finally, freedom from tapwater.\" Good quality, no complaints. Hot and cold water. It is a little low so they offer a base that brings it up to normal person level. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Primo Warer Cooler\" Our water cooler sprung a leak after 10 years and we needed a replacement. This water cooler has been an excellent replacement. The hot water is hot enough to brew tea. Very happy with the price and value. \"Keeps Water Cold and Dispenses Hot Water\" Great water cooler! We get the jugs filled at the grocery store. This set up cost us $160 upfront, but it saves us a ton of money over buying water bottles or signing up for a water delivery service. It's also better for the environment.Pros:Works greatWater is very coldDispenses hot water quicklyCons:It's low to the ground, so it's a little awkward to fill bottles/cups. This could be remedied by putting the cooler on a stand of some sort, but then it would be awkwardly tall to load the new heavy water bottles. This is a very minor inconvenience, I'd recommend getting a bottom load cooler if you can't bend over/load from the top. However they are more expensive and you have to deal with additional moving parts (water pump). n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Keep your eyes peeled...\" I did go and buy it at the nearest Lowe's and I printed the product with the price of $149.00 on it but when you go in the store it is priced at $179.00. I do know it is a good product because I know some people [3] that had them from a few years to several years and had never any problems with them. This is my first electrical water cooler, I still have my old water cooler [a ceramic one] that I kept for almost 30 years. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Good Investment\" I have been pleased with it so far. The only thing I don't like is with me being nearly 6 foot tall, it seems like a long way to reach down and get water, especially when filling a pitcher. It would be nice if it were a little taller. The hot water is great for instant coffee and set up was easy. \"Short and leaks after bottle replacement\" I have had this water cooler for a week. We bought the first bottle of water and loaded it with no issues. It cooled and heated the water great. It was a bit on the short side, but we were willing to live with that and even considered constructing a base for it to sit on to lift it about a foot.We finished our first 5 gallon container in 3 or 4 days, and I exchanged the bottles before I went to bed. When we awoke, we found 5 gallons of water on the floor. The water is leaking from the Top of the cooler. I refilled the old water bottle with the little remaining water from the 5 gallon container and placed that on top to see if it was the water bottle, and the same leak persisted.Hopefully they will refund me for the lost 5 gallons ($14.99 since it was a first bottle and not an exchange) along with the cooler. Not sure if I will give this particular cooler a second chance. \"Stopped cooling after two years\" I like the cooler, looks good dispenses water fine, but after two years stopped working. The compressor kicks on but the water never gets cold at all in fact it's always room temperature. When it did cool the water really wasn't that cold anyway. I've re-set the unit followed every troubleshooting guide. Primo just says re-set by un plugging unit, wait 24 hrs. Plug back in and you should be all set, did that several times no luck. You have to be careful when it stops cooling the unit will grow bacteria. n/a Easy set up, even easier to operate. Very cold and very hot water within a matter of minutes of hookupQuiet operation. \"Leaks\" After 1 1/2 days came home to find water all over the floor. Most of the parts were wet so it was difficult to track the leak. Bottom line...it's crap. Don't buy. Should be a 0 star review, but that's not allowed. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Primo Water Dispenser\" I love this water dispenser. I live in a place that you can't drink the tap water and this is a savior!! Definitely recommend this product and it's very quiet heating element is a plus. Oh,and Lowe's beat everyone else's price!! Thank you Lowe's! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Top load water dispenser\" So far, so good. The unit is only two weeks old. It is a replacement for a bottom load dispenser that lasted only two months. That unit was a different brandThis one is so quiet, that I can't even tell when the compressor is running.The water comes out properly cooled or piping hot from the two spigots. I like that you can select to heat or cool water independently. It's not all or nothing like some dispensers. \"Awesome water cooler\" This water cooler is awesome! The water from it comes out cold like right from the fridge and even hot like you just finished boiling it! Would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great water cooler. \"Good for the price\" Works well. Nice having hot water instantly without having to wait. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Flip of a coin\" Heater went out after 4 months. A replacement is on the way. If #2 fail's they will send me another one. I keep the one I have. I doubled down with a 2 yr Service plan from Lowe's. Went I'm done Lowe's will refund my purchase. Good for the next 3 yr + How cool is that? \"Great water fountain. Very quiet. Looks good.\" We have had five or six water fountains before, some rented, some bought, and this is the best so far. Take it out of the box, put in a water bottle, plug it in and turn on the switches on the back, and you are set. No big assembly. Very quiet which was important for us, since ours is in the living room and our last one (a rental from Poland Springs/Nestle) was very noisy and made all kinds of strange sounds. The hot water is probably not hot enough to make tea right from the water fountain, but it sure speeds up boiling the water, and its good for warm drinks. I love the push button (like the drink fountains at restaurants), so you just push your glass against it to fill it. For hot water you need to also push the button as a security measure for children. Looks pretty good too with the stainless and black. It is a lot shorter than our last one in height, so you have to bend down more to use it. We might get a little stand for it (we are all tall though). \"Primo Water Cooler\" I purchased this water cooler because I liked the look with the black and chrome exterior and the price was reasonable. The appearance is much more professional looking than the typical white coolers. I would recommend this product. n/a Only used for 3 days. Will see how it works a month from now \"Awesome Product\" I'm glad I purchased this dispenser, not only does it dispense cold water but it also heats it, the price was great considering the benefits it provides. I'm thinking of purchasing a couple more for my family. Very happy overall. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Good product\" Great price. Easy installation. Bottle is super easy to install without the heavy lifting. The only thing I did not like is that there is a center button that should be for room temp water. But it does nothing. Instead you have to push up and down a small red button on the button to the hot water for room temp water. \"Easy load\" Bought this and it works great! We didn't need hot water and we liked that we can turn off the heating and or cooling and just have room temp! \"Descent priduct\" This cooler works great, I'd gladly recommend to anyone. One thing that upsets me with this, was the store i purchased it from (lowes) assured us that there is a night light in this unit, the owners manual stated it as well. However this unit DOES NOT have a night light. Be careful buying descriptions are false \"Primo White Bottom-Loading Cold and Hot Water Cool\" After reading positive reviews I purchased this cooler 2 weeks ago. Set up was easy and has been working well. Water is cold and hot water is extremely hot. I would recommend this cooler. \"Primo White Bottom-Loading Cold and Hot Water Cool\" After reading positive reviews I purchased this cooler 2 weeks ago. Set up was easy and has been working well. Water is cold and hot water is extremely hot. I would recommend this cooler. \"Cooler Works Great\" The bottom loading cooler work great and it is super easy to load the bottles of water. I highly recommend this cooler. \"Hot water does not work.\" On & off the phone with Primo. Still no hot water. Returning it, getting a refund! \"I don't usually write reviews, but it's loud\" Works as advertised, but it's loud. I think because it has to pump the water up (the water doesn't sit on top, it's down below), the pump has a loud sound, plus the cooling and heating system. I wish I could return it, but it's only just started being loud (had it 6 months or so now). I have another type at work with the water on top and that one is quite, but this one is annoyingly loud! \"primo company\" I purchased this water cooler a couple of weeks ago it stared leaking after a few days. I called Primo after a few trouble shooting questions rep said they would send me a new 1. I received it 4 days later and after 2 weeks no leaks and working like it should. Very happy with the out come \"Love it!\" Works great and it is nice to not have to lift the bottles anymore. It dose have a small rattle sometimes. But the box was damaged so that could have been the cause. A tiny piece of cardboard fixed it. \"The Primo IS \"PRIMO\"!\" Very easy to set up and switch water jugs. If you want a hot cup of tea or make instant coffee, it dispenses very hot water in a safe manner. Relatively quiet for all it has going on. Cold water will be very refreshing this summer - really looking forward to it for my family and pets! Appreciate the free shipping from Lowe's! \"Nice!\" The ONLY thing that was misinformed about this cooler... it does NOT have a night light where the manual says it does. It is only a green tiny light that is where the cold water comes out. Other than that, dispenser is much better than old fashion ones where you had to lift the 5-gallon heavy jug of water \"Hot Cold Dispenser\" waters not as cold as I would have liked - otherwise a great purchase \"Cold water, easy setup\" After reading a variety of mixed reviews, we proceeded to order the bottom loading cooler after our ancient top loading cooler expired. Bottom line, water comes out nice and cold, hot water is really hot. Easy to load the 5 gallon jug in and we no longer have to look at it since it is hidden down below. Quick setup with no problems. Only one minor design flaw and that is the spouts are difficult to see when standing in front of the unit to dispense water. One must bend over to see where the they are located otherwise you can have a torrent of water flying out and missing the cup. Needs some graphic indicators on the front to make it easy to line up your cup with the recessed spout. We added our own large red and green round stickers to help with lining up a cup or glass. Otherwise, good product. \"As expected\" I have owned this cooler for 3 weeks and so far have no complaints. Everything is working as expected and hoped for. \"Water Cooler is Great!\" Super easy to load a five gallon water jug on the bottom. Streamline and looks good in kitchen. Great and Recommend for home use. Glad I picked this style. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Excellent Value\" This is my first bottom dispenser and so far I'm very pleased. I really like the buttons being on top, don't have to bend over all the time. However, the hot water button child safety feature is too simple. U simply push the button forward and then down. Wouldn't take a 3 year old long to figure out. The 5 gallon water jug being at the bottom is also easy on the back. The quality is above average and it appears to be pretty sturdy. The water comes out piping hot or ice cold. \"Water dispenser\" Wasn't looking for a super expensive water dispenser. Also was looking for a bottom loading one and this was definitely the one with the best price. Only thing is that it doesn't have a room temperature option just has hot and cold but still works great! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Great addition\" Purchased for my mother in law, she uses it for tea, ramen, drinks and thoroughly enjoys it. I appreciate it being a bottom loader and not spilling everywhere. \"First Water Cooler\" I am really satisfied with this water cooler purchase. It is really easy to load a 5 gallon jug and hook it up..Love the fact I don't have to heat up water or tea or instant coffee. It comes out boiling hot so the tea bags are giving you great tasting tea in 3 minutes. The price of 149.99 is well worth it.. \"Doesn't Last\" Bought it a little over a year ago and it worked great until after the warranty went out. We started to notice a burning smell and realized it was coming from the Primo water cooler. We unplugged it over night and the smell went away but now the water taste like the burning smell. We have changed the bottle of water out twice and it still taste like burning plastic! Wouldn't recommend buying unless you buy the 2 year replacement warranty!! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Like This a Lot!\" We actually had to purchase this twice: the first one arrived in excellent condition, and set up was exactly by the book, but after a couple of hours, we noticed that the cold compressor never shut off. The hot water heater was cycling off and on, but not the cold. The machine seemed to be putting out a lot of hot air, so we shut the cold switch off overnight and tried it the next day, with the same results. We called Primo and were offered the choice of them sending out a new one (with us shipping the malfunctioning one back to them), or return it to our Lowe's store, which is what we did, for a no-hassle refund. Plenty of apologies all around from Primo and Lowe's. They had water dispensers in the store that seemed very nice, but all our appliances are white, so we reordered at the website again. The second one arrived in perfect condition, set up went great, but the hot water button did not depress. We called Primo again, and the customer service representative talked me through a minor adjustment that needed to be made; something had dislodged during shipping, but it was an easy fix needing only a screwdriver. That was a couple of weeks ago, and we have both hot and cold water at our fingertips whenever we want it. Even though we got off to a rocky start, things worked out to our satisfaction. The hot water is plenty hot for instant beverages such as tea or cocoa, and the cold water is very refreshing. We think the machine looks great in our kitchen and suits us perfectly. \"So far so good\" I am really liking this water cooler so far, my only complaint is there is no light. When I was looking at the product in the store I was under the impression that there was a light, even the documentation that came with the water cooler references a light but, there is no light. I would give a five-star review if there was a light, especially since I was led to believe that there was a light included. \"Primo\" We drink more water now as a result of owning the Primo Water Dispenser. Water tastes great and is always cold; which in Arizona is a real bonus. \"Works as advertised\" Perfect fit for our kitchen. Easy set up and safety on top to prevent accidental hot water pour. \"Primo White Bottom-Loading cooler\" I got this because I wanted a water cooler and thought this would be great since I wouldn't need to lift the heavy water jug into the cooler. First, the door wouldn't stay closed and then when I tried to fill a 2 quart jug so I could fill my pets' water bowls around my house, the water stream was so slow it took more than 5 minutes to fill the jug. I did this only ONE TIME and decided nope returning this.I have returned this. I still search for a good bottom loading water cooler. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Delivered in poor shape\" I'm not sure if this is due to faulty manufacturing, poor quality control, or what, but this machine was delivered with several vital components disconnected. First, the instructions were followed to a \"T\", plugged it in, and waited while the pump filled the tank. After a few minutes, water started pouring out of the overflow hole all over our office floor (carpet, of course). Quickly unplugged, turned to Google to see how to disassemble, and found that the small electrical wire connecting the overflow bobble sensor was not plugged in to the motherboard. Took it apart, found the slot on the electrical panel, plugged it in, and finally no more water pouring all over the flow. Next, after a half hour, we went to fill our water glasses, and nothing. No water came out of either hot or cold spouts. Again, took top off, turned to Google, and found that the spigots inside the device were not lined up on the little plastic runners. Push button for water lifted these plastic runners, opened the hose to allow water to pour. Saw both hot and cold were not connected, so we connected these. Finally after about a gallon of water on our office carpet, we finally have a water cooler we can use. And YES, it was delivered like this. NO, we will never buy from Lowes again, and NO we will never buy a Primo water cooler when this one finally goes out. Would NOT recommend this product, or from Lowes, as this was shipped from a Lowes facility so it had to be have been handled extremely rough for all these components to come unplugged. Would not buy Primo again, because of this same reason as well. \"Great !!!\" I bought this over the summer and my husband and I love it!!! No more buying cases of water every week. We buy 4 5gallon jugs and they last about 2 months!! I would recommend this to anyone looking for one!! \"Primo bottom load water dispenser\" I absolutely love this bottom load water dispenser. I had the top loading dispenser, it was good, but with my arthritis I could not lift 5 gals of water always had to have someone to help. So, I opted for the bottom loader and it is so easy to put the 5gal water bottle in, just slide in the bottom of water dispenser. If I can do it, anyone can...so, buy one you will not be dissappointed. Lowes had the best price and free delivery. \"Loved it\" We love our new Primo water dispenser. We got it for a great price as well. \"So far so good\" Have had this about a week now. We only have the cold water turned on but like the fact that we can have hit if we choose. Love the fact that the bottle goes on the bottom, it's so easy to change the bottle! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"OK but has flaws to be aware of\" It's a nice device, but it's too tall to sit on a counter. It blocks the cabinet door. You need to sit it on a table . The button is too stiff. When the bottle is near empty the pressure needed to push the button can shove the device across the counter and if you're not careful on to the floor. \"But a different one\" The water stream is ridiculously slow and you have to keep lifting the bottle to get air bubbles in to continue flow. The button is very hard to push in and the reservoir tank mentioned in the video is non existent. The bottle sits all the way onto the poked piece so there's no room for it to fill. \"Do not purchase\" I purchased one of these and it wouldn't even fill a twelve ounces glass of water before it stopped. I wouldn't recommend this unit to anyone. Spend more money and get a product that works. \"Worthless\" Had to lift bottle off and pour into reservoir. Don't buy. Lowes's was good about taking back. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Bad Unit\" Unit came in quick, well packaged, and looked nice, but it didnt work right. After setting the jug in place, water would only flow for about 3 seconds, then would stop. I tried another jug to see if the seal on the first was the issue, but the 2nd jug did the same thing. I had to lift the jug off the stand to get the trapped air to flow to the jug. I returned it to the store with no problems and no hassle \"Sucks\" All the other complaints x 10. The stream was so week I took the first one back today, what a mess taking 5 gal. water jugs on and off. It was so bad I knew it was broken and explained this to the return folks who were very good about the whole deal. So I bought the same one again, guess what, a flea couldn't take a shower in it's stream. Do not buy, what a waste of time, junk environmentally awful, build things that last and actually work. \"Works great\" When I read the reviews most said the water spout only released so much water. I purchased for my son and once he released some water and removed the water bubbles he hasn't experienced that problem again. \"Leaks\" Started sporadically shooting water out during second bottle. \"Great water dispenser.\" Convenient and easy to clean/maintain dispenser. Affordable. Highly recommend. \"Very slow to dispense.\" This only lets out a stream about 1/4\" and takes forever to fill a pitcher or the coffee pot. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Primo Cooler\" Works well. This is the second one we have had. They last a year or more, and do a great job cooling and heating water. We have no complaints. \"Great Purchase Quality and Value\" Easy set-up and install. Hot or Cold water in an instant. Very easy to use as well. I wish I had one of these at home years ago. Gonna Buy another one for upstairs soon!! \"This thing is great! :)\" I read all these reviews and thought I must be an idoit for still wanting to get this cooler. But I have no regrets, Iv had this cooler for 3 weeks. Most reviews said after 2 weeks it went to crud or after changing the jug it wouldn't stop pouring out so I kept the receipt and the box for all this time to be safe. But no worries! When I went to Lowe's to grab one I had to lay it down in my car, so I was worried that because it laid on its side it might break like everyone else's. So when I got home I set it up and let it stand for about 2 hours before putting the jug on.The water comes out pretty cold, but I don't ever need the hot water function. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Works great!\" I bought this to replace my other one that I loved, and I love this one just as much. It is smaller, too, so it doesn't take up so much room. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"water cooler\" i have wanted one of theses for years , but would never buy one for myself. Ibought this one for my daughters first house she loves it and uses it all the time, when i am over i use and and now will buy one for myself. \"Great water dispenser.\" My daughter had one at her office and the whole staff loved it. The water is cold and the hot is great for making tea. \"Great price\" This cooler works very well and is affordable. Love it! \"dont buy\" I bought this think it was going to be good it was replacing a bottom load from the same company. I read the reviews and figured hey it might be fine. Boy was I wrong within 2 weeks it started leaking. took it back to lowes product was refunded. I was told it cant be exchanged or upgraded. did some looking both top load models lowes sell have the same problem and the company (primo) is aware of it. stay away from the top load spend the extra money and get the bottom load machine save your self the hassle of returning the product. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"I love my cooler\" I bought my cooler over a year ago and also purchased one for my daughter and we both love it. We each had a leak once, but it was due to a tiny hole in the water bottle. I would reccommend this product to a friend. I am even purchasing two for work! \"Primo Water Dispenser\" I am very happy with the product. It is exactly what my wife and I wanted and nothing more. The water is very cold (on the cold side, of course) and the hot water works great for a quick cup of tea. There's not much to say about it really. It is a basic stand alone water dispenser that functions as expected. No bells and whistles. I have not had any problem with leaks. I am only on my 6th or 7th 5 gallon jug. At this point I can't really talk about durability but I don't expect any problems. I recommend this dispenser as a good one to start with. \"Leaks, leaks and leaks!!\" This is the third and last water cooler we will purchase from Primo (Via Lowes) The first water was a bottom loader, the water pump failed a week before the warranty was up. Fortunately Lowes refunded the entire purcahse amount (Thank You Lowes) then we purchased a top loading Primo cooler the same day. It lasted a couple of months before it started leaking (From small hole next to cold water faucet/dispenser) We retuned it, Lowes exchanged it (No questions asked, thank you again!) That was about 6 weeks ago, same problem develops from little hole next to the cold water faucet/dispenser, but this time only when we have the hot water switch on, turn it off and no leaks, but we purchased this product for the hot water feature, not just for cold water. Also Primo says its our bottle...........wrong. We were out of town for 10 days (Unplugged the cooler before we left) Not a drop of water anywhere. Plugged it back in when we returned home (Hot & Cold features turned back on) same problem exists. Will make another return to Lowes tomorrow. \"water dispenser\" i seen lots of negative reviews about his product, so i bought it anyways. so far so good no leaking nothing messed up went through 3 5g bottles and everything is fine. i think that you have some people that don't have a clue on how to treat product or read directions then that leads to broken dispensers, \"Water cooler\" I love this water water cooler! It's stylish & very easy to use! \"Works great\" The spigots just need to be up a little higher but no big deal, other than that it's just fine. \"DO NOT BUY - flooded my kitchen on day 1\" At my household we have had a water cooler for 22 years and I have never have had a problem with the two models I have owned. In 2003 or 2004 I purchased the Primo model #0900172, which I was extremely happy with. I even moved it twice (once out of state) and it kept on going and going and going. Sadly it died last week. Having bought not only the Primo water cooler model #0900172 but also more than 5,000 gallons of drinking water over the last decade, I considered myself a customer of Primo.Not a minute longer.In my search to replace the water cooler I checked out Primo water coolers, what else? After all I had thought highly of the company. Turns out the majority of the models are black/stainless. That should have been the first clue that something is wrong at Primo. Have Primo's designers been in any kitchens lately? Lots of people have white appliances, including me. I am not going to put a black/stainless water cooler next to my white refrigerator.Thus, my only option was model 601141, which looks like made from cheap plastic. Reading the reviews at Lowe's website I noticed that a lot of reviews complained that the water cooler did not last very long. Having no other option I purchased model #601141, plus an extended warranty for 2 years.As I unpacked the water cooler at home I noticed that the package included a coupon that expired in 6/2014. That too should have been another warning sign. I set up the water cooler and luckily put it on a boot tray. About an hour after that I drank a glass of cold water. The cold water dispenser worked fine. Later in the evening I wanted to fix myself a cup of tea.I pressed the lever and filled my tea cup, then released my index finger, but the hot water button was stuck and about one gallon of hot water spilled out on the floor. I had to find a sharp instrument to push it out of its position and up again. My new floor (1 year old) got flooded. Please note that the picture shows only a bit of the water on the boot tray. That's because the water came out with so much force that it spilled way beyond the boot tray. Luckily it did not burn my feet because it wearing house shoes.That's it – Primo “good bye”. My best guess is that Primo is well aware that this model is a cheap model, which causes many customers problems. A company, who is concerned about its reputation would have recalled the water coolers and checked what the problem is. However, it appears that Primo does not care but simply lets the customer test if the water cooler is ok or not, and if a customer's floor is getting flooded like mine, so be it.Since the coupon was valid from 2013 to 2014 there would have been ample time to recall that model and put out something better.Also, how about creating more options – white, stainless, and black water coolers? An appliance is supposed to fit to other appliances.And what's with that clip bracket? A water cooler is supposed to be a free standing appliance. Plus, the water cooler makes a weird noise, which may be normal but since this one is made from cheap plastic I can hear it, whereas I never did when I owned model 900172.These days my household consumes ½ gallon water per day, which adds up to 180 gallons per year. That's lost business for Primo. I cannot take the risk of encountering more inconveniences. Saving on production costs at the expense of loyal customers is not a good idea. Good bye. \"Cheap and Effective Model\" I had just got this water cooler. I have seen many before, but I have never installed one before. Within minutes, I had figured out how to use it. This is a very affordable water cooler and it is very durable. I most definitely will be buying more products from this manufacturer! \"Disappointed\" Had the unit for 11 months loves it until we replaced a 5 gallon water jug and by morning empty .5 Gallo,a of water in our carpet. Continued to empty unit and plenty of water in cold side but hit was empty so problem was hot water side. \"Great Unit!\" I purchased this unit because I was tired of amassing a giant pile of empty plastic water bottles. It works fabulously with the hot and cold water. \"$99.00 - 10% + tax = Happiness !\" I got a 10% discount coupon from Lowes and wanted a water cooler!After looking at all Primo models and realized that all of them have the same guts. In other words all models have the same mechanics (compressor, heater, etc.) only the outside is different,I chose the least expensive at $99.00, (I guess people rate looks not performance)After running for 12 hours the cold water temperature was 41.2F and Hot 174.3F (measured with my infrared thermometer).End result $99.00-10%+tax=Happiness! \"Great product so far\" Bought this a couple of weeks ago to replace our old one from around 2005. Energy Star, bright white plastic, easy push button controls, can't get much better than this. \"A Primo Selection\" Works as described in the product description. Very pleased with the unit. \"Water Cooler\" I love my new water cooler, also has a hot feature for making a cup of tea. Love that I can turn off the hot button when it's not in use. I recommend this cooler. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Excellent water cooler\" We looked at numerous water coolers and this one did everything we needed and at a cheaper price. \"Unit began to heat up\" Purchased the unit in October 2016 and the unit only made it 9 months. Unit started to get hot and leak water everywhere and luckily I caught it in time. Called the company and they are replacing it because it falls under the one year factory warranty. Funny thing is when I called and explained what happened primo barely wanted to know what caused it. All the company said was it falls under the one year factory replacement warranty and they will be sending me a new one. I asked what to do with the old one and primo said to discard/throw it away. I just thought that was crazy. Who wouldn't you want to know what happened to the old unit or at least in inspect it!!! Must happen way to often!!! \"Defective twice\" bought set up is easy. put the water jug on started leaking cold water from a hole to the right of the cold water spout. i think it might be a air hole. carpet is soaked. then it started leakig hot water. returned got different on. guess what yep same thing. returning today. i will give props the water is cold and hot on the other side. \"Water was not as cold as old one.\" prefer the metal tank units. They have colder water.Unit rturned. \"Water dispenser\" For the price and basic funtion this is good buy. Keeps water cold and the hot water is really convenient. n/a hot water stopped working 2 months after I purchased it... less than a year later I came home yesterday my floor was soaked... all the water leaked out from the bottom not buying Primo anymore all made in China! \"Excellant Water Cooler\" We purchased this water cooler for our vacation property and love it entirely. It's very easy to set up, and works like a charm. The only thing that we would change on it is that there be a 'room temperature' tap rather than just a hot water and cold water taps. (But that's really nit-picking because we knew that when we bought the unit.) Suffice it to say that we are very happy with the purchase and pleased with the unit's performance! \"It works great!\" Wonderful switches in the back lets you turn on/off cold/hot temperature. \"Poor Quality\" If I had the box, I would return this item. Once you release the button..whether it is hot or cold, water continues to pour out. Made of cheap plastic and very light and tippy. Even though there is a wall support Not interested in putting a hole in my wall. The buttons do not light up. The measurement from the actual spout to water catch tray isn't very large, nor does it have good depth. So forget about fitting anything under it except a med. water glass. Disappointed. Do not waste money on this product. \"Water cooler\" This water cooler is perfect for standing around and chatting with my roommates while we sip ice cold water in Arizona. Worked out exactly as anticipated! \"Leaking Water Cooler\" Purchased a Primo water cooler just like the other review. Worked great, but it kept leaking and getting the wood floors wet. Returned the unit and the replacement did the same thing. Primo support said I had leaking bottles which I did not. Then they said the over flow needed to be drained (includes completely draining the bottle). Must do this every time it is overfilled. Turns out that when flipping the bottle to place it on the cooler, you run the risk of overfilling the tank, which causes the leak. This cooler only works with bottles, that have a seal to puncture (bottle service usually). DO NOT USE this cooler if you use your own bottles. If you do, you will have wet floors. I returned the second unit for another brand that works with my bottles. \"Save time do not purchas\" Purchased this in Feb 2015 with 2 year protection plan worked well for 4 months then after replacing a new bottle and hour later hear dripping noise in kitchen found half the 5 gallon water bottle leaking on floor. Removed bottle emptied bottle and emptied resivoir replaced bottle and all was ok for another 2 months. Then after. Replacing another new bottle in early evening found the next morning water all over kitchen floor and bottle 3/4 full inspecting this I found same issue others had with water coming out of vent hole near cold water tap. I returned it and got the same a replacement agiain in early evening only to find this new one doing the same leaking the next morning. Well took it back to Lowes next day this time upgrading to a bottom load cooler. Purchased another 2 year warrant as I found out it only covers one time replacement, will see how long the bottom load one holds up now. Don't buy one without the warranty it does help. \"Great Little Unit!\" Maybe I am writing this too soon but have had the unit just 2 hours and it does not leak and works great. It doesn't have bells and whistles as other units do but who needs them anyway? I registered online and if anything happens I can get it replaced. I don't know what people want for $99. I like the feature in the back that allows me to turn off either hot or cold water or both. Of course I could just pull the plug!So far I am happy with it. I would recommend it. If you want a thermostat, clock and lights...buy something else. \"Not good\" I did not do any research about the product since It is not some complicate product. it is easier to put together, I had same issue as the first review. I bought yesterday , but I will return the product tomorrow, n/a I purchased this in December of 2013. It boiled the water in the 5 gallon bottle in April 2014. I exchanged it but 8 week later the cold water no longer works. Got a refund and am looking for a new cooler. This is a bad one so look out. \"Will leak and ruin your floor!\" This is a terrible cooler, avoid it at all costs! I've actually been through 2 of them so far. The first one lasted about 6 months. I took the top bottle receptacle off to clean it and when everything was put back together, it leaked out an entire 5 gallon bottle. I thought maybe I didn't put something back together right, so I went and purchased a new one. Well that one leaked after the third bottle change. Again, it was the same thing, the entire, full 5 gallon bottle leaked out and ruined my floor. And this was from a unit which was barely 3 weeks old. Obviously there is a design flaw. I use the primo brand water bottles, and always exchange them at Lowes, so the problem can't be blamed on an off-brand bottle or a self-refill job. Do not waste your money on this piece of junk, unless you like floods! \"Great product!\" We like this water cooler so much, we bought another! I love turning the heat option on and off. Our first primo water cooler lasted 7 years before we gave it to a friend. Impressed! \"Cold hot water cooler\" We are very pleased with this purchase. We are also finding we are drinking a LOT more water with it. It was very easy to set up and looks nice in the kitchen. It did not take but a few minutes for the water to be cold and/or hot. My daughter always has one in her kitchen and we are very happy to have one too. \"Worked Great...Until I Attached the Second Bottle\" We loved our water cooler for the first few days. The water was as promised -hot or cold-depending on the tap you used. Liked the safety lockout on the hot water as it prevented a sleepy surprise one early morning. But when we used up our first five-gallon bottle and made a bottle change, the water cooler had a tiny little drip from the side of the cold water tap. We thought it must have run down the pipe after we exchanged the water bottles.We were wrong. When my wife went back to get a drink a couple of hours later, the cooler had leaked more than half of the five-gallon bottle into the floor. She pulled the bottle off and quickly emptied the cooler. When I got home, we carefully looked the unit over to see if there was something we'd done wrong. After not finding anything according to the checklist for leaks, we carefully put a new bottle back to replace the one that had leaked. Everything looked fine...for a couple of hours. Then, I found myself mopping up even more water.I returned the cooler to Lowes and exchanged it for one of the twice-as-expensive units with the water bottle underneath the machine.24 hours later, it's working like a champ and we're getting the great hot and/or cold water we expected -with no problems. The manufacturer calls the top loading unit their \"Best Value\" for the money, and I hope ours was one of the units that every company has that fails. They are terrific products -and we are still fans. Just wanted everyone to be aware that the top-load units might not be the best way to go. \"Not Happy with How Long It Worked\" We bought one of these Primo water coolers six years ago and it would not cool when we tried to use it. We returned it and the replacement unit stopped cooling and started leaking around the top collar after three years of use in our kitchen. We bought another Primo water cooler, which I believe was the same model, and it also stopped cooling and developed a leak around the top collar after about three years. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \".....WATER SPILLAGE....\" ....THIS COOLER WAS \"ONLY\" PURCHASED ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF A SALESMAN AT LOWES....TRY INSERTING A 5 GALLON BOTTLE OF WATER....AT THE VERY LEAST YOU WILL NEED A LARGE TOWEL TO CLEAN UP THE SPILLAGE....I HAVE OWNED THIS MODEL FOR 1 1/2 YEARS AND CLEAN WATER EVERY TIME...WE HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING BUT SPILLAGE ALWAYS OCCURS....I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE REQUESTED A SALESMAN WITH A SECOND OPINION.....!!!! n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Horrible water dispenser\" This was a great product for a while, then while we weren't home, the motor burned up. We were lucky just the dispensers was burned, not my home \"cold water valve leaks by\" Bought little over a year ago. Don't use often. Cold water valve already passing. Pan overflows in less than a day. Makes a mess. I wish I would have read reviews before buying. Beware of this poor quality dispenser. \"leaks\" We bought one a year ago and it started leaking from the bottom after about 10 months. We decided to buy a second one and we got it and this one leaked immediately not only from the bottom but in the front as well. Returned it and won't buy another one. \"Good for the price\" Good dispenser for the price. Convenient hot water dispenser so you never have to wait for hot water. Would definitely reccomend. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. \"Product Stopped Working\" In less that two years, the cold water stopped working.

Really awful customer support. Do not buy this unit, it is a waste of money. \"Just what we were looking for\" It works great! There is really nothing to put together. It is quiet. We are really happy with it. \"Great Alternative to Buying Bottled Water every we\" We bought this water cooler back in 2012. It has paid for itself many times over!! We've been very pleased with it and had no problems until a few days ago. My boyfriend noticed a puddle on the floor and both the dispenser and water jug were extremely hot. We think that maybe the hot water part shorted out. The recent negative reviews make me wonder if this is still a worthwhile product. n/a There is no review to accompany this rating. 2 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern Love it...

The unit leaks slow thru the hot side when turned on- Returned back-Will not purchase or recommend-n Does what it should. Works as it should. Dispenses water like I've never seen before.n Not a great product....many issues that seems ridiculous Motor is loud when pushing up water to reserve tank.Hot water is not available at all times. There is a button you push first, then must wait maybe 5 minutes. We use 5 Gallon Water Bottles. This machine only uses 3/4\" of the water then will shut off. You have to put a new 5 gallon bottle in, save the 1/4 left from the other bottle, then wait till the new bottle is reduced enough to add in the 1/4 balance from old bottle. Yup, pain the in major butt.n Great Product The water dispenser works just great. It was so simple to get set up and started working immediately.n You've got to try this dispenser it's great. work's great. we enjoy having hot or cold water any time we want!n Excellent water dispenser unit There's not much to be said about this product other than it's a great water dispenser unit. For those folks who have questionable water supplies or just need an extra source of fresh water in the house, this is a great item. n The look of this unit is pretty sleek. Black and stainless steel go great and the unit has a fairly small footprint so there's no need to worry about this thing taking up a whole lot of space in your kitchen/office/etc. n Setup is breeze. It takes your standard 5 gallon water bottles so you can purchase those anywhere. SImply plug the unit in, attach the siphon (probably want to give it a good wipe down first) to the water jug and slide it in the unit. And since this is a bottom load unit, SOOOOO much easier to handle as opposed to the older top load units. Plus it's a lot easier on the back. Once you load the bottle in, there may be some noises coming from the unit which is normal. It can be loud depending on your tolerance but nothing out of the ordinary for me. Water is chilled pretty quickly however the hot water can take some time. n For extra piece of mind (as far as fresh water is concerned) having a unit like this is almost imperative IMO. With the relative ease and maintenance of this unit, plus the added benefit of additional drinkable water, I think this is a great add-on for your house/kitchen.nRead Less Missed the Mark Loud and takes a while to heat up. The water never fully leaves the bottle and the room temp water is a joke. I did better with my 75.00 Black and Decker modeln Not drinking city water anymore. When we first moved into out home, I knew the city water was no good. There is so much calcium in it, that it would actually crystalize in the back if our toilets, and plug up our faucets. I really did not look forward to passing a kidney stone the size of a grapefruit, so we purchased this. Even with the filter on our refrigerator, we could definitely tell a major difference in the water quality of the spring water that we bought for this, and the city water we were drinking. Home Depot sells the water jugs for around $6 (after purchase of the first jug whiz is about $14. Then you just exchange them for a new one each time. I love that it's a bottom feed, and that the jug is completely hidden. It's not loud at all, and the hot water only takes about 2 minutes to get smoking hot. We are so happy that we decided to get this water dispenser, and will feel much better about the water we drink.nRead Less Great item This has been a fantastic item so far. I used to have a top loader. However, with age, this became more difficult to use. Now, I just slide the bottle right in. The only function I've used on it is the cold water. So, I can't speak to the heated water or the room temperature water. But I have no reason to believe that there would be any problem with either of these functions. I think this was a great purchase.n Nice buy Nice buy,I like the fact that the water bottle is hidden .n Dispenser Works really good easy to use and easy to load the water bottlen Great Product I purchased this water dispenser about a month ago and dispensed a little over 10 gallons of water through it.It does make a little noise when it pumps the water into the reservoir, but it's only for a minute at first to fill; then for seconds when refilling. I had to adjust the temperature setting a couple times to get the water as cold as I like. It's perfect chill every time. I haven't used the hot water, I tested it when first purchased and you have to wait a minute for it to heat up, but comes out very hot.I like the design, the dispensing buttons on top, the lights, and the best is not having to flip the jugs on top of the dispenser.I don't have any cons yet, only purchased a month ago so hopefully none will arise.nRead Less It looks really nice... I seasoned it.. but took ten gallons to get the smell of plastic out...which is normal. I let the unit sit upright as recommended...except I left it for couple days before installing(just to be sure). The first thing I noticed was how loud it was when filling tank from bottom, which is after a full glass of water(not good when u have a newborn). Then I didnt like the waiting for water to heat..I could stovetop it faster. Then we noticed the water wasnt cold enough, so we adjusted the unit to go colder. About one month after I got so tired of hearing it click on, then keep clicking(compressor). Too loud! Then the unit stopped cooling alltogether about four months..luckily hd has an awesome rtn policy...maybe I just got a lemon, but Im going to a different brand.nRead Less lasted less than 1 year I bought this online about 9 months ago from Home Depot. It worked fine during that time. However it stopped working today for no apparent reason. Dissapointed have to go buy another one this soon. No i cannot recommend.n Didn't work out of the box That's not exactly right, the hot water did work briefly (less than a day), but quickly stopped. Having to return.n great dispenser Great dispenser , very easy to load and looks really goodn Love it!!! It is a bit noisier than a top fill cooler. The pump pulls the water back up to the refill housing for dispensing, thus the noise. However, with that said, it is much easier, to place a refill bottle full of water, in the bottom compartment than lifting on a top fed cooler!!n Good Purchase so far Bought this for my mother in law for christmas, she loves it.n Glacier Bay Water Dispenser Nice looking water dispenser, looks great with my other stainless appliances. Only had it for a few weeks so far, however, room temp water comes out as cold as cold water and motor is a little noisy when it runs. Hot water takes a few minutes to heat up, my other dispenser had hot water on demand; for me tho, it is not a deal breaker.n Glacier Bay H2O water dispenser The dispenser works as advertised. The stainless steel suction pipe is very sturdy and doesn't leave metallic taste on the dispensed water. We hardly use the hot water function except in the morning for tea and coffee. All in all; a good buy for the money.n water dispenser Easy to set-up works great as well as looks good in homen Bottom Load Water Dispenser in Stainless Steel This cooler is nice looking, a little noisy at times, but I like the fact that you don't have to have an ugly water bottle on top. Also it's nice since I'm getting a little older and don't have to lift 40 pounds of water over my head to refill it. It's a little more than I wanted to pay but so far it is worth it.n Works Great! The cooler was very easy to set up and works great. It looks nice too! The only issue we have with it is that the 3 gallon bottle we purchased is too big and the pump device does not sit all the way in the bottle but it does work great anyhow.n great product I just set up the dispenser and was quite easy setup.. Looks great the only slight problem is the noise the motor makes sometimes.. You shouldn't be too concerned and the price is about right for the quality. The other models dont look so nice and look fragile...n Very pleased, ices up too easily though We got this for my AARP-card-carrying parents. I won't go so far as to call them elderly yet... but they're at an age when lifting a 5 gallon jug of water over their shoulders is an activity we should frown upon. This is a bottom load dispenser which means there is a trap door on the bottom (the stainless steel part), which opens to reveal the water jug and dip tube. To replace it, all they have to do is push a new jug into the trap door (no lifting required), and drop the dip tube down into the bottle.n It has a \"holding tank\" on the top. It pumps water up to the top section where it has a small reservoir of heated and cooled water (a glass or two of each). When you pour a glass it turns on a small pump to suck water out of the jug and up to the reservoir. Neither myself or my parents found the noise particularly annoying or loud as other reviewers indicated. It doesn't run the pump all the time, only after water has been poured.n The heater works well, but requires a 30 seconds wait period to take it from luke warm to \"hot tea\" temps. The cooler on the other hand, gave us a lot of trouble. At first we thought it was broken because it wouldn't dispense cool water... only room temperature. We realized (after a small puddle formed) that the cooling system had iced over and wasn't making cold water. We played with the temperature knobs a little and found a happy medium where it dispenses cold water and doesn't ice up... but it was like cracking a safe to dial that knob in just right. That said, it was a one time annoyance. Now that everything is dialed in it has been running fine.n All around, a fantastic replacement for the traditional gravity systems that require lifting the water jug up.nRead Less As advertised The instructions clearly state to place the newly arrived unit upright for 12 hours before plugging it in. This is very true to allow the refrigerant to settle into the bottom of the unit at the compressor. I did not notice this instruction and attempted to start the unit without doing so. It did not work and I re-read the instructions.n I did unplug the unit over night and then re-started it the next morning and it operated as it should have.n Decent Water Cooler with Quirks I wanted a bottom loading water dispenser since I have difficulty flipping those 5 gallon bottles. In doing research, there are really only 4 manufacturers of these things. The Glacier Bay unit is actually made by Greenway and also sold under the Vitapur label. I've waited a month since purchasing the unit to write this review.n The other bottom loaders use a plastic straw to suck the water into the dispenser, while this model uses a metal one. I believe, long term, the metal straw is a better choice. The bottles I use are 5 gallons with a handle, so I have to set the straw length for 4 gallons rather than 5, but the straw rests on the bottom of the bottle and as I've measured the residual in the 5 bottles I've used so far, never has it left more than 1/4 cup of water.n The \"kettle\" feature, rather than a constant hot water supply was a plus in my opinion since I wasn't terribly interested in hot water dispensing, but being able to heat some up as needed is nice- It gets hot enough to make a Cup o Noodles or coffee/tea. Also, most of the other brands have problems with their hot water tanks leaking. I haven't actually notice a temperature difference between the \"cold\" and \"room temperature\" buttons, so take that under advisement.n Noise wise, the unit makes moderate noise when the pump is pulling water into the reservoir. It can be for up to a minute when the bottle is nearly empty and it starts running after you've dispensed about 10 ounces of water . There really isn't a way to make it quieter as all pumps make a bit of noise when operating, and sound deadening material would act as insulation meaning it could overheat.n The cooling compressor is quieter than my refrigerator, but seems to run for an inordinately long time. I rarely see the optimal cold temperature light turned on for my machine.n Performance wise, it is a water cooler. I mark them down for the overpowering blue lights on the front- why does the name need to be light all the time? A night light switch would have been nice.n I also wish the filling area was concave to allow a more stable surface when filling. Making the drip pan removable would have been nice instead of having to lift the entire door panel for draining.n Complaints:The door design. It's not a door, it's a panel held on with magnets. Yes, it makes loading bottles easier (especially with the ramped bottom) but extension hinges would have accomplished the same thing.n Also, the \"cap\" and straw have this large handle- it serves no purpose. It doesn't lock the cap onto the bottles- so why all the excess metal?nRead Less Great item Overall great water dispenser. I enjoy that it's a bottom loader rather than the top. The nozzle allows you to extend or retract to the size of water container you put inside. The magnetic door is nice so you can remove the entire front door to make it easier for loading bigger water containers. The price is a little more than I wanted to pay but overall I'm satisfied with my product.n Water dispenser Very happy with it. Water stays very cold. No leakage. Easy to clean. Grandchildren use it with no accidents.n Great for Home or Office I've used this Glacier Bay Bottom Load Water Dispenser for a little over a month now. Beyond unpacking it, there really is no setup besides adding the water bottle. The unit itself looks very nice and will fit well in a nice kitchen or office. The stainless steel appears to as good of quality as any appliance in my kitchen.n This dispenser has a number of features I like. Loading a water bottle in a top load dispenser would not be an issue for me but I simply like having the bottle out of sight. The kettle feature (which provides the hot water) is only turned on when you need it. This is what makes this an Energy Star rated product. There is also a safety feature for the hot water dispenser button. It's nothing complicated but should prevent a small child from inadvertently dispensing hot water. I like the blue LED above the dispenser area. It is a tad bright but it's not an issue for us.n The main compliant I've seen in other reviews is the noise. I will say that you clearly know when the pump is filling the reservoir but it runs for 30 seconds at best. I personally don't think it is loud. I have no cons to report, in fact this dispenser has worked perfectly for me. Add to that the savings of buying bottle water in bulk, and I would say this is a great buy.nRead Less Has helped me drink more water This Bottom Load Water Dispenser has helped me drink more water. The convenience of nice cold water was the key. The bottom load is nice, it hides the 5 gallon jug and makes changing out very easy.There is some noise that it makes but that is to be expected because of the refrigeration of the water that is taking place.The hot water is not constant it takes about three minutes for it to heat up which is no big deal. By not having the water stay hot 100 percent of the time saves energy.Great cooler I would definitely recommend getting.n Set up very easy.

Seems that everyone has the same issues. Had for a little under two years, replacing one that was 7 years old (different brand). Worked fine but didn't like how slowly the water came out. Also, having to wait 2 to 3 minutes for hot water negates the reason for having. Easier to use microwave when you want hot water for coffee or oatmeal. Anyway, the reason we got rid of it was it started making a humming noise that got progressively louder over a period of a few days. This is the only time I wish I purchased the extended warranty from Home Depot. STAY FAR FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS UNIT.n Same as everyone else I bought one for my parents and one for me. Literally both stopped cooling around the same time. About a year after purchase date. Iu2019ve tried getting Home Depot and the Glacier bay company to help me reset the compressor or replace it all together since itu2019s too late for a refund but this is totally not worth the money. But an extra $20 for another brand. Glacier bay should really stop selling these since everyone has the same exact issue. This is stealing. I regrettably didnu2019t search reviews before buying thisn In less than 2 years the cold feature has stopped working. It gives you room temperature water no... In less than 2 years the cold feature has stopped working. It gives you room temperature water now.

As many others have experienced, this item lasted two years and stopped dispensing cold water. Troubleshooting did not repair. Home Depot customer service only tells you to purchase another, but does not even offer a discount to make that purchase. Vitapur is the mfg of this item, and at least they offer a discount on the purchase of another, but you have to buy it directly from them, and it ends up costing you more than at the store. There are so many complaints on this water dispenser; why can you fix the problem? These things end up in dumps.

This product is a rip off, I bought one of this water dispensers on 2/16/16 and it only lasted me just a bit over a year and it stopped working. It was always a hassle and a struggle to invert the 5 gal. water bottle on top of the dispenser. Not recommendable at all for senior's use at home. I would not recommend this product at all.

Never liked the fact that the small center cap would be floating in my water every time. Can't load bottle without that little cap as water would end up all over. Also didn't like that water would pool around the bottle neck and if it wasn't dried between every bottle, it would get slimy. Yuck.But now, like so many others here, it has stopped cooling.

Its very well made and worth the money we paid.n My only real complaint is that the product had a short lifespan of only about two years. The fail... My only real complaint is that the product had a short lifespan of only about two years. The failure seems to be from a bad compressor. First it started making a lot of noise and the cold water turned room temperature so we unplugged it. When I got around to taking a closer look at it I the problem had progressed to the point where the overload protector was constantly tripping and resetting. So I give it a poor rating on quality.n I hope you like the taste of vinegar.......expect to waste an entire 5 gallon bottle before the v... I hope you like the taste of vinegar.......expect to waste an entire 5 gallon bottle before the vinegar taste is gone.n Lasted just about 2 years. Loud, not particularly cold, and it died at around the 2 year mark. Junk.n Loved it until now We've had this at my small office for about 3 years and last week it basically stopped getting cold.n Water Everywhere It is hard to install a water bottle without a cap. Is there a secret to do it without spilling water everywhere?n Do not buy! I've had this product a little over a year and it no longer cools water. Seems to be a consistent issue if you read the reviews, which I wish I would've done!n NO ROOM TEMPERATURE ! Good that I red the reviews before buying. I don't drink cold water, my kids do. My 13 year old dispenser finally gave up. I am discovering that nowadays they mostly make HOT & COLD ones. Was so happy to find this dispenser on the HD website and for such good price. Was ready to jump in my car.But first I red the 1 star comments. And there it was! No room temperature water. The vender answered with an apology: mistake in the description. Should not be so hard to change that on your website.n glacier bay water dispenser this unit work 2 years and after it stop cooling. we try to replace it on warannty.at home depot they told us that the warannty was one year and that's all. we try to make it repair by the company... no way.n we bought an other place and another company.n Set up procedure is bad The set up cleaning process in the manual needs to be updated. You find this out if you call them. After adding the vinegar you get no flow from the hat water valve. My first reaction was bad valve, return the unit. called the number provided and it was explained that at this point there id not enough water to reach the hot valve. Continued with setup, it takes at least 2 gallons of water to get the vinegar taste out because the hot side has not been drained. I would rate the unit much higher if I knew about this when I started. As I said I almost returned it.n Junk Leaked and stopped cooling water after 10 months. HD should be ashamed. So should Glacier Bay. So should China.n Don't recommend We don't recommend this product because it only lasted two years for us. The cold water feature no longer cools the water. We used to have a Sunbeam that lasted for years and was still working when we sold it at our yard sale. We only sold it to get another to match our new stove and refrigerator. I regret that. It also did not seem to cool the water as well as our old one.n The water dispenser The water dispenser was received in good shape.

We use to have a drinking fountain that wasn't used. People would come to the pool with their own isolated containers and no way to refill them while at the pool. The Avaion Water Cooler is the answer. We have received a number of positive responses for this in place of the drinking fountain. The unit looks nice and is holding up well. The only complaint is the cost of the replacement filters. So far this hasn't been a big deal. All in all this is a well made unit and is working well for our community's needs. Well worth 4 stars.n Bottleless Water Cooler This answered my dreams! We used to live on well water and always had bottled water delivered, so got used to having hot and ice cold water always available. When we moved to a place with city water I really missed the convenience of having hot and cold water at the tip of my fingers. I hate having to heat water for my tea and wouldn't dream of microwaving it, which changes the taste, so having hot water available is great! Didn't want the hassle of water delivery or storing the bottles either. My husband hooked this up in about 20-30 minutes and I have been joyful since.n Easy setup.

I recently connected the Avalon hot/cold water dispenser in the office where I work so that I could get feedback from more people. It is connected next to the water fountain that we have been using for a number of years. Installation was actually easier than I expected. The in-line valve fit the present connections perfectly and there were no leaks detected. After the water heater indicator light turned off, I tested the water temperature and found it to be about 180 degrees. The cold water was also fine at 40-45 degrees. The water does come out a little slow, but that is likely because of the filter. After dispensing water, the valve turns on and re-fills the tank for a few seconds, making a little noise. The compressor for the cold water makes a little noise when it first starts and then it is very quiet. The safety button on the hot water dispenser works fine. The cold water tasted good with no odd flavors or odors. The instructions were not horrible with only about about 7 misspelled words. Not sure why this still happens since spell check. One section that I could not figure out was \"If the appliance is making a soud, there should be leakage. Please check the PCB on the palte. Repair machine and dry the PCB, and then power on agin.\" What?? Also, Self-Cleaning is a little misleading considering the elaborate cleaning process described in the user manual although there is a weekly self-cleaning process using ozone that is used to sanitize the lines and tank and only requires the push of a button.nRead Less Great product and very beautiful Great product and very beautifuln After I finished its setup.

The replacement filters are a bit costly but they do last at least a year,although they recommend replacing them every six months. The only thing that I am experiencing problems with is the low flow of the room temperature water. It starts flowing good, but after a cup and half it drops down sharply. I have contacted customer support and followed their trouble shooting steps, but all seems fine. In order for me fill anything larger than a cup, I have to depress both the room temperature and the cold buttons at the same time. Also, the LED light is a good idea but not very bright. It could be brighter since the unit is black in color in the dispensing area. The dispensing buttons on the top are a very good idea. I am still considering keeping it.

The hot won't cook your ramen noodles, but will make a cup of freeze-dried coffee without too much coaxing. Not boiling, but hot enough for most uses.n Not what I expected The water is not ice cold and you cannot fill a large drinking glass because not enough space.n It's perfect for the price...nice quality, looks nice and works beautifully! It's perfect for the price...nice quality, looks nice and works beautifully!n Not recommended I have always wanted a hot/cold water dispenser for my kitchen. This model is not too big or too small for my kitchen.n It worked out of the box but the manual is not professional and needs to be updated the unit is really poorly designed.n  My only problem with the dispenser buttons is that they are very tough to push and hold while filling and I have actually had my finger pinched once when releasing the hot water button. It hurts and I got a bad wound.n Better options out there It works, but for the price, not so much. Every time you need to replace the cooler, there isn't a big enough reservoir to catch the spill off and water goes everywhere. Not beneficial to someone that has to buy their drinking water and can't drink tap water.n I bought this water dispenser to replace a Primo unit. This unit works well to dispense cool wate... I bought this water dispenser to replace a Primo unit. This unit works well to dispense cool water, but the compressor hums much more loudly than the Primo did and is much louder than our refrigerator. I set the thermostat to the lowest setting so we wouldn't have to listen to this noise so much. Also, the Primo unit had a switchable light to illuminate the glass fill area and this Glacier Bay unit does not.n Too Loud Bought this product to use when my well was condemned and was waiting for a new well to be drilled. The dispenser does a good job of keeping water cold and hot and ready to drink. The problem is the cooler is extremely loud. This machine is as loud as the basement jet pump when the compressor is running. When the cooler comes on at night, it is loud enough to wake my young children. As soon as I get the new well, this will go straight to the barn where the chickens will have to deal with the noise. n It does stay cold and the instant hot water is nice to have for making tea, but the noise is not worth the convenience. n I would not recommend this product.n DID not last I purchased this on 8/9/16 and the hot water dispenser does not dispense. I was leary about the Brand. I had a Whirlpool prior to this thing and it lasted over 20+ years. Never again.n Works Great -- Compact Design The Glacier Bay Water Cooler has several great features and works wonderfully. This unit has a clean and compact design, which takes up little room, no matter where you place it. The cooler has good water pressure, which is delivered in a steady stream. The unit is extremely quite and has the ability to cool as well as heat water. It even has indication lights on the front, blue for the cooled water and red for the hot water, which lets you know when it has reached itu2019s desired temperature. n On the back of the water cooler, along the right side, you will see a series of knobs and switches (refer to the fourth picture). Just be aware that these locations donu2019t match the diagram provided. The top knob is the fuse for the unit, which you don't have to do anything with. The second is a red toggle switch. This switch controls whether or not you would like to turn on the hot water feature. The third area is used to adjust how cold you would like the water to be when it is dispensed. This is done by taking a flat head screwdriver and turning the lever until you reach the desired temperature. n You don't have to worry about your little ones getting scolded with hot water either. Not only do you have the option to not turn it on, via the switch in the back, but it also has an additional safety feature. In order to use the hot water you have to push down a red tab, which is located on the side of the hot water button, before the button will depress and dispense the water. n The only thing that I will warn you about is during the initial cleaning phase. You have to remove the water bottle support collar. It is tight and can be difficult to remove. Keep applying steady pressure and before long it will begin to move. Don't use any tools, because you could damage the unit.nRead Less Very Nice This product has everything we needed. Hot/cold water, fits into a small space, child safety for the hot water button. The only con is that the water dispenses too slow but because of the value/cost it more than makes up for this issue.n Dollhouse water cooler! You may want to sit down to fill a cup as the machine is very low to the ground and water simply trickles out of this machine.n Not wanting to beat a dead horse, but.... There are a ton of pictures of this product, and pretty much goes for the features of this dispenser, so I'm not going to beat a dead horse, but this thing is great. I live in the Youngstown, OH area, and lets just say that the water quality is (NOT GREAT!), so we try not to drink it if we can help it. We already have a dispenser in the kitchen, but I wanted one for the garage as it has been extremely hot, and I have been drinking way to much soda to keep cool. n When it arrived, I took it out of the box, placed it in the corner, and put the 5 gal water jug on. Within a few minutes, the water got extremely hot, and a few after that, it was extremely cold. n As for function, its quiet, works well, easy to use, has lights that help indicate which side is which and the water taste 100% better. My kids are drinking more water not that I have this in the garage, and since my garage is heated, I can keep it out there in the winter and make hot chocolate while working. n All in all, its not the most high class looking water dispenser, but it will work with most any décor, but most importantly, its functional and my kids are drinking way less sugar water because off that.nRead Less Not happy The hot water doesn't work I'm not happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'nnnnnnnn Child safe I got this for our church. We put it in the childrenu2019s ministry. Those who serve can have cold water on the hot days and come winter if it gets cooler they can have Hot tea or even Hot coco. The best feature no worries of the children getting the hot water on them. You can only access the hot water by pushing in the red tab on the side of the hot water button then depressing it to dispense your hot water, really safe for the children. Helps them get in the habit of drinking good water instead of all the sodas for a healthier future. Perfect for the home, office work shop or any place you may have a need for hot and cold bottled watern Cold glass of water anyone? Very nice water cooler for just the right price. This is a smaller more compact water cooler that can hole 3 or 5 gallon jugs of water. The compact design of this water cooler can be a great thing or it can be a bad thing. It is great if you have limited space as it does not take up as much room as many other water coolers, but the compact design also means that the water outlets are lower and you will need to bend over further to reach them. Not so great for elderly or anyone with back problems. n The hot water heater can be switched on and off. The temperature can also be adjusted and it heats the water quite quickly. I personally leave the hot water heater switched off as I have no need for it and it is the part of the cooler that used most of the electricity. The water isnt boiling hot but it is hot enough for things like hot chocolate and tea. The cooler incorporates a safety on the hot water button which makes it more difficult for young kids to tamper with which is a nice feature. The cold water takes longer to cool than the hot water takes to heat. The cooler has indicators on the front that light when the water is at optimal temperatures. To me the cool water comes out at a great temperature. Its plenty cold enough, but not ice cold. n The setup of the cooler is fairly straight forward. The cooler comes fully assembled. The directions for setup and cleaning are pictures only. The lack of a word description along with the pictures makes them a bit difficult to understand but the setup is fairly easy. When you first unpack the cooler. If you had the cooler laying on it side at any point you want to leave the cooler in an upright position for at least 12 hours before using. This is normal procedure for anything that uses refrigerant. It is advised to do an initial cleaning of the cooler before you use it. You clean the cooler the same way you clean your coffee machine. By flushing it with water and vinegar. This will get rid of the plastic taste that can introduce itself into your water from a new machine. Even if the water and vinegar does not completely get rid of the taste of plastic. Its absolutely normal as with any new machine and the taste will go away over time and use. n All in all. I really like this cooler. I would have a preferred it to be black and stainless steal like the rest of my kitchen appliances, but that is just me. Some people will love the white because they have white appliances. I would also have preferred for the water to dispense a little faster but it dispenses fast enough.The cooler functions quite nicely and you will be hard pressed to find a better one as modern looking as this one in the same price range.nRead Less Works good Works great it's a lil short but what u going to do I go a 2 and 4 year old my 2 year old can't push the water button down witch is a good thing I think but saves me 49 a month with the water delivery so it's great always cold and it's not even all the way on cold good product for the pricen Easy to Use This is a light end model of water dispensers but one of the best features is the dual spigots. Top loading models have the disadvantage of being heavy to load but use gravity to feed the well. I like that you can adjust the thermostat for the cold water to either keep it chilled or really cold. Hot water stays on all the time so there is never a waiting period.n Great dispenser Despite all of the negative reviews, and being a bit skeptical when the unit arrived, I myself am quite pleased with this hot and cold water dispenser. It will accept three or five gallon size jugs.The water can be purchased at my local home depot for about thirteen dollars on initial purchase then it's about half of that when you return the jug for a replacement. That saves money- Even if you purchase the twenty four packs of water at your local grocery store, those savings still don't compare going this route.As for the cooler itself, it dispense hot and cold water. There is a thermostat control on the back for the cold water, and an on/off switch for the hot water. Child resistant safety switch on the front for the hot water. It's compact and easy to use. Overall a great water dispenser.nRead Less NO instant hot water - even though they make it...

The hot water is as it states HOT and cold is cold but not as cold as with ice cubes. The unit is stylish and appears well made. I like the stainless steel on black it fits most kitchen styles with modern appliances. As for a work area this would fit nicely in a small office.n Love This Unit This is a very nice addition to any area where hot and cold water are needed. I installed this in my shops warm bay. Since we use this area year round we can have hot water for lunchtime instant noodles or instant soups and tea to warm up in the wintertime. n The unit dispenses hot water in under a minute and has cold and room temp water on demand. The unit had some packing material inside the cabinet that made it noisy when cooling water, once that was removed it's much quieter. n We use a 5 gallon glass carboy for our water. Since we have very good filtered well water in the house we just keep cleaning and refilling the carboy. Makes water cost for us almost zero.n I can't say enough about having hot and cold water available all the time. Itu2019s also a great thing to have for company. I can see that this would be a great investment for most kitchens since the cost of 5 gallons of water is a fraction of the cost of other bottled water. This keeps tons of used water bottles out of the landfills too.nRead Less Good quality dispenser It has worked without any problems.

Additionally, We did notice a small serge in our electric bill but that was to be expected.n Sleek and stylish. Great look for home use. Dispenses very hot and ice cold water I havenu2019t had this dispenser for very long, but I really like it, and it looks nice in my finished basement, where my family and I watch TV, and I have a small office. Not having to run up and down the stairs to the kitchen for a glass of water is very convenient. This dispenser is sleek and stylish, with a clean look that arguably is more attractive than most dispensers that coordinate well with the décor of an office environment, but look out of sorts in the home. The dispenser requires no assembly, but should be thoroughly rinsed with a 50/50 solution of water and distilled vinegar to remove dust and any contaminates prior to use. The unit is well-constructed with a stainless steel exterior cabinet that does not show smudging and fingerprints. A 6-ft. electrical cord provides flexibility in terms of placement if an outlet isnu2019t conveniently located behind the dispenser. Hot, room and cold water is dispensed by tapping the appropriate button on the unit for the desired temperature of water. The hot button features a childproof safety lock that must be operated simultaneously with the button to dispense hot water. The fill area features a small blue lamp for dispensing in low light, and is approx. 8-inches high, which will accommodate large travel mugs. A small reservoir catches the drips. The dispenser uses 3 or 5-gallon water bottles (not included) that sit on top of the dispenser. This model does not feature a tap for hookup to a water line, but other model Vitapur dispensers do. The unit makes a little noise when first plugged in electrical outlet and periodically when the cooling element kicks in, but itu2019s barely audible and turns off after the cooler reaches the desired temperature. The dispenser lacks a storage cabinet in the base, but units that have the storage area arenu2019t usually refrigerated, so I donu2019t find them to be all that useful. The black plastic is glossy and easily shows dust and smudges. Ice cold water is dispensed from the cold side of the water dispenser while depressing the kettle button sends piping hot water to the hot side, eliminating the need to heat water in the microwave oven or on the stovetop for instant coffee, cocoa, tea or morning oatmeal. At about 30 lbs., the dispenser is lightweight. The base is narrow which can make it tip easily if accidentally bumped into, so it should be placed close to a wall or in a corner, or in an area with low traffic. There is a short, 3-second, delay for the hot water using the kettle feature, and the hot water tank is small, but is sufficient for several cups of hot water. Itu2019s difficult to dispense water with only one hand, but all things considered, this is a very nice water dispenser and is ideal for use at home or in a small office.nRead Less Does a fine job This is a pretty basic water cooler, which at this price point is about as much as you can expect. Even though there is nothing particularly fancy about this it does dispense cold water and that's what I wanted it for. The hot water is not an \"on demand\" type so when you want hot water it heats it up first then you can dispense it. This is about a 1 minute process, give or take a few seconds. This is not a big deal for me because I really only use it for the cold. Make sure you follow the directions and rinse it out with a vinegar/water solution to get any plastic taste out.n Great Perfect for me right out of the box.Easy set up after initial clean.Attractive design and keeps the water at the right temperature with very little noise.n Cooler leak at 4 months Only had the cooler for 4 months and the hot water spigot constantly drips. Calling Glacier Bay for warranty.n do not buy.... I'd hate ya to hear \"I told you so\"! This cooler is junk! You have to press the red button and wait a few minutes everytime you want hot water. When it heats up, it sounds like a jet taking off. Super noisey. I buy around 500k in building and remodeling products a year thru HD, this has to be the worst product I have ever wasted my money on. It is going back Monday morning. Hopefully you'll read these reviws before buying this. I had another cooler in mind when I went to buy this, HD showed they had 8 different coolers to choose from, in stock. They had 2. That was very dissapointing. I thought I was buying the better of the 2. I sure was wrong!!! If you buy this,,,, remember this phrase..\" I TOLD YOU SO!\" DO NOT BUY!!!!! Glacier Bay should stick to ceiling fans.nRead Less leaks! bad news Don't Buy This unit. I had to put a towel on the floor as it leaks from the bottom and on the top. The top where the bottle goes in needs a gasket as it leaks down the outside to the floor. plus you need to heat up the water first before you can use it. you can only get about two cups from the hot water at a time. The buttons are too stiff to work so you feel like they will break sooner or later. I returned it to the store so please don't buy this unit. I hope you read this...n Complete Garbage Actually lasted about a half a year before the compressor gave out and stopped cooling the water. Water splashes all over when replacing bottle, and top becomes dislodged. def not recommending to anyone ever.n Surprise surprise I bought this cooler alone with other products from Home Depot, to take with me to the Dominican Republic., where we just bought an apartment. It never worked. The compressor was dead on arrival. Don't waste your time and money in this product.n Not a good buy I am frustrated that the water cooler stops delivering water cold.n Love this dispenser The disign of the dispenser is slimmer then other dispensers. I have had 2 other dispensers and so far this one is better than the others.n Looks nice, and that's All Should have read some reviews before I bought it. The first thing I noticed was there really aren't instructions. Just pictures that don't necessarily make sense to anybody besides the author. Cleaned with vinegar and followed the setup pictures. Spilled water at top when placing jug. Pretty standard for these, so, okay. The water does not heat instantly. You have to wait for it. I can do that in a kettle or my microwave. The cold dispenser is slow. I mean sllllooooow. Plus - You can't fit a gallon jug at the spout, which is something I planned on doing all the time to make crystal light and other drinks. Fill your coffee carafe? No problem if you've got a couple of minutes and your back doesn't hurt from being stooped over. Needless to say - Going back to Home Depot tomorrow. On a secondary note to Home Depot. I'm pretty loyal to you guys, but some of the junk I've purchased from you lately is making me rethink that loyalty. Just saying.nRead Less Confusing instructions Just purchased and in the process of cleaning. In looking at the instructions #'s 11-14 allude to some nozzle that dispenses water in the rear. In inspecting the machine, I haven't been able to find this nozzle. If anyone has any insight that would be great.n Looks nice. Clean, fingerprint proof device. Looks great next to other stainless steel appliances.n only lasted 1 year and a month Water leaked out from the top after placing the jug and hearing a pop. Guy at home depot said this is common. Says there is nothing that can be done.n Looks attractive & works well (thus far) We've had this water dispenser for a couple of weeks and it's been performing well thus far.n Design:Well made, feels solid, looks attractive. The glossy black & stainless steel finish is modern and makes it look sleek. The stainless steel does not attract fingerprints which is excellent. It is a bit lower than I thought it would be. Our 20 month old can reach all the controls dispense cold water but of course she cannot dispense hot water as it comes with a safety lock feature.n Installation & Preparation:It comes fully assembled. Once removed from the box it is recommended to let it settle for a while before plugging in. It includes picture instructions for clean-up and preparation. You need to clean the unit before use. It requires special water dispenser cleaner OR using hot water & vinegar. I used water & vinegar and it took 15 min or so to complete the recommended cleaning. The water still tasted like vinegar after cleaning so you need to waste a couple more cups of fresh water than what they recommend.n Cold Water:You can adjust the temperature of dispensed cold water using a screwdriver. The dial is located at the back of the unit. When the water reaches the set temperature, a solid blue LED light turns ON in the front of the unit. Dispensing cold water is easy and the flow is strong. It is relatively noisy when cooling, even noisier than our side-by-side fridge. But luckily it takes only seconds to re-cool the water!n Hot Water:This unit offers hot water \"on demand\". It has a \"kettle\" features which means it will not heat the water unless needed. This will save tons of energy and is actually what gives it the Energy Star label. It takes 2-3 minutes to heat the water up, so press the button before you actually need it. It feels like a long time but if you go do something else in the meantime then time will pass quickly! The water comes out very hot and good enough for hot tea. It gets a bit noisy as the water heats up. To dispense hot water it has a safety lock feature that requires getting used to when using one hand.n So far we are happy with this unit. I hope it lasts long enough without leaks or failures!nRead Less So Far Its excellent I have been using this fridge for 2 months now and I love it. Cold water temp can be adjusted from the back but I'm using the factory set temp because its cold enough to not cause irritation to the mouth. Hot water is on demand and it takes 30 sec to heat up. I have not experienced any leaks or low pressure in the water. Push down buttons are sturdy and the hot side has a child lock. The fridge makes very low noise, we eat in the same room with no issues. Overall, I'm very happy with this choice and I recommend it in every household.n Good Water Dispenser This is a very good filtration water dispensing machine. I like to have the hot water ready to go for a cup of tea or instant oatmeal. The cold water comes out very cold. The instruction manual was mostly pictures with some text. Once I figured out what some of the pictures were trying to tell me, it was not hard to get this system up and running. It showed that you must wash your hands and keep whatever would be in contact with the top opening and the jug of water clean. It said to first use vinegar and water to clean the system through and then rinse with fresh water and dispense 2 cups each of the hot and cold spigots. The water though, still tasted of vinegar for awhile. I made some tea and served some cold water. Very good and convenient.nRead Less Works as it Should Only had mine for about a month now but it works as planned & needed....n Item was delivered well packaged (shipped) inside a plain cardboard box containing another box (the retail package) surrounded by foam. The dispenser was securely cradled within the retail packaging with no damage. Installation is simple & the cord was ample length for our needs. My only complaint/wish is that the head on the cord would have been much better as a 90° so it would lay flay against the wall, helping to prevent tripping or accidental breakage of the wall outlet.n I opted to purchase a 5-gallon bottle & it worked fine. Spilled some water, as expected. Had a little issue with the 'Low Water' light staying one after I installed the bottle but it did turn off a short time later; once all the air in the system worked its way out. For our needs, the cold water was the only needed option. It is colder than room temperature but not to the coldness of a household refrigerator. Maybe this is something I can adjust but haven't looked into this as of yet.n The overall look & fit/finish of the product is nice. It has a small blue LED glow so it is easy to see at night.n The rising price (18% increase in the last 6 months) of store bough bottle water [gallon size] here in CA led us to the need for a dispenser. We now pay less than 50 cents/gallon using our own 5-gallon bottle as compared to about $1.30/gallon shelf price and reduce our dependency on waste from plastic bottles. Made good financial sense for our needs.nRead Less attractive bottled water dispenser This is an attractive bottled water dispenser that delivers hot and cool water. It also features room temperature water but that is really just the hot button with the kettle button turned off. It came pre-assembled so the only set-up is the initial cleaning with a water and vinegar mixture and plugging it in. Once the initial cleaning was done all you have to do is put the bottle of water on top and youu2019re ready. The hot water gets very hot so the child guard is a good thing but itu2019s a little awkward when using. We initially had an issue getting water from the hot water u2013 found out that we hadnu2019t waited long enough for the initial heating. After about 30 minutes it worked. Now when the hot button is pressed, itu2019s ready in less than a minute. You have to have a special water bottle top. We were lucky that the one we got already had that kind of top. We really didnu2019t like the picture only instructions. Some were not clear. Since weu2019ve only had it a short time, I have no idea how long the features will last. For now, it does what it says it does and looks pretty cool. It appears well built. The design seems well thought out. The hot water heater only runs as you use it, so it should save energynRead Less Water, Water Although packed well. Looks good and easy to follow instructions I did find a glaring oversight. The ad and description states this is a hot,cold filtration water dispenser. Not as delivered. The filtration system is another product and purchase! For another 50 dollars or so that is a big misprint.The filter and proprietary bottle system is available. Uses standard commercial service bottles also.After following instructions about cleaning prior to use the unit has worked week for the week of ownership. The larger bottle/cup area is a plus for use with tumblers or taller containers. I experience no odd smells or taste changes. I advise to NEVER use tap water due to the mineral content that is know to kill water coolers.nRead Less Brand New Junk Just purchased unit, did not plug in, cleaned per instructions, tried to run water thru hot and cold spigots. Hot side would not dispense water at all. Cold side did dispense water. Tried Hot side several times, no water, drained via cold side. Read instructions again, decided to drain reservoirs from drain on back to try to clear air-lock. Refilled with water, Hot side still would not dispense water. Drained again, saw some small back fragments of plastic but not big enough to plug the lines. Refilled again and drained over and over, never got it to dispense water. I got a tire pump and pumped backpressure into the faucet side with the valve open and could hear it gurgling. Refilled, no water would dispense from Hot side. The box says do not return to store so I guess I will call HomeDepot tomorrow and see if I can return it because judging by other comments, servicing is not good! This unit is junk in my opinion, a brand new unit won't pass water out the Hot side, forget about it being hot, I never even got to plug it in! Don't buy this item, in fact steer clear of Glacier Bay, it's not even a real company, I can find NO information online, it must be a HomeDepot subsidy, and a bad one at that. This unit deserves 0 stars, 0 quality and 0 value in fact it should have a negative value because I'm out $150.nRead Less Good Home Water Cooler This water cooler is great for the house. The water temp is adjustable and works well. The hot water runs on a kettle system. It is not on demand and takes 3 minutes to heat up.The cooler does have a refrigeration component to it so it does make some noise but nothing to crazy.There is also a little blue light that is on all the time. It actually provides a nice nightlight in the kitchen for night time.n It is also energy star approved.n I think this is perfect for a family home or small office.n Functional And Good Looking The water cooler is functional and easy on the eyes. The operators instruction are awful because they are mostly just pictures. I had to clean the cooler before it was used but it didn't take long they suggest to use vinegar or a water cooler cleaner so have some on hand before you start the cooler. The cooler has a kettle function so you have to press a button to heat the water and it takes about three minutes but it saves on energy and if I had a coffee maker it would take longer than that so no big deal. I see a lot of reviews that have a concern with the spear in the top but you can buy a cap that slips on your bottles and it's reusable plus it can be bought just about anywhere on line or local stores. The cooler has a blue light that's on all the time and the hot water has a safety lock feature. There is also a cold water light that lets you know if the water is cold and a dial on the back to adjust it colder or warmer.nRead Less Handy Handy source of dispensed hot or cold drinking water. Initial setup was time consuming but once ready just add water bottle and your ready for use. Only heats water on demand takes about three min. Cold water is adjustable. Unit is noisy makes as much noise as my refrigerator when running and has this annoying blue led light that never goes off. But with these exceptions the unit meets my family needs for a source of usable water in a small footprint in my kitchen. It's not an out of the box use item. Read instructions which are difficult to understand and clean out dispenser before use. Water bottle must be purchased separately.n Not Worth It Piece of junk. looks like a nice unit at 1st, but don't judge a book by its cover. Stopped giving cold water from 5 months of purchase and when it doesn't work, they only warranty you for the small problem ( which rarely never occurs ) than the big problem ( compressor issue ). I was referred to a repair shop who claims that its a cheap unit HomeDepot purchased from China which they can never get access to the unit schematics to understand it better. So was insisted by the repairman that the repair cost was almost same price as a brand new unit so i should junk it. Thanks Homedepot!n Disappointed Purchased this dispenser 4/16/2014. Very disappointed. Water comes out slowly from spigot. When you place a new water bottle on it, it splashes all over. Even with the thermostat set higher, water was not that cold. Takes 20-30 seconds for the hot water to heat up. In May, 2015 quit working, it wouldn't get water cold. Called Home Depot customer support. The were great and connected me to Glacier Bay. They thought since warranty was just over by a month that they might replace it. Glacier Bay informed me to have a repair person to come and look at it. If it was the compressor they don't replace that and if it was a thermostat they would replace it. It was not worth it to pay a repair person to come look at it. Will NEVER buy Glacier Bay again!nRead Less Good Purchase so far Keeps the water cold and does not leak, does the jobn Glacier Bay Water Cooler Water Cooler works very well. Only drawback is you need to wait for water to heat up, maybe 20-30 seconds. Otherwise a very good product!!n Made poorly, leaked in 2 days Took home and followed the directions and it leaked in 2 daysn not verry good poor at best water bottle on top is shaky , my big problem was it leaked from the cold dispenser after 60 days , returned it for another brandn So Far So Good So far my experience with this cooler has been very good. The cold water temp can be adjusted with a small screwdriver via a control dial on the rear of the machine. At the max setting it's perhaps not quite as cold as a bottle of water from the fridge but close enough. The hot water is definitely suitable for brewing a cup of tea or for making instant coffee. However, because the machine is \"energy star\" rated you must push a button and wait a minute or two as the water heats. This is what they refer to as \"on demand\" hot water. Kind of a minor annoyance but It does save money since the water is only heated as needed. When the hot water is ready to dispense the button's light stops flashing and goes to solid red. There is virtually no set up other than running a quick cleaning cycle before first using the machine. As for aesthetics, the unit is nice looking assuming you're happy with modern stainless steel styling.n The main \"con\" with this dispenser is the tiny intake spout. If you use a screw-on cap & ball adapter (available for a few dollars at most water stores) or the special caps that are pierced in the center as the bottle is placed on the machine you'll be fine. That said, if you don't use an adapter you'll have a bit of a mess on your hands because the intake fills instantly as you tip the bottle causing water to splash and/or overflow until the bottle is seated.nRead Less Broken in Two Months I bought one of these from Home Depot. Looked nice. Has all sorts of warnings about how it must be left to stand in a vertical position for 24 hours before turning on. Who has room in a typical car to \"stand up\" a water cooler box? Perturbed already, I waited until the next day to set it up. It has bright lights. Why does every appliance come with lights? Just heat up and cool down the water. if there is need for an indicator, it needn't be equivalent to airport landing lights. But I digress. This thing heats up water only as you need it, so if you need hot water, say for a cup of tea, or instant coffee, or to heat up the baby's bottle, or whatever, you have to wait 45 seconds for the quick boiler to work. I learned to live with that aggravation after a while. Then it broke. No hot water ever again. Very disappointed in this product.nRead Less water splashes out I love the fact that the water gets very cold, like refrigerator cold, but severely dislike the fact that the reservoir is so small that when I replace the jug the reservoir fills up and as the jug is lowered it pushes water out and it splashes water all over the place. I had their cheaper version and this did not happen because the reservoir was much bigger. I gave it only two stars because of the tiny reservoir but other than that I do love the cooler.n Cold water function broke after 1 year Bought this product about 15 months ago. The water no longer dispenses cold. Very difficult to troubleshoot. Customer service was not helpful, they told me I didn't live near a repair center (I live in Houston, its a huge city). They suggested that I call a small appliance repair shop, that shop told me it cost $100 in labor to look at the appliance and I was better off just buying a new one.n very poorly designed product, will not accept standard water bottle I purchased this product last week and found it had something called a piercing valve which with a normal water bottle gets in the way of installing a new bottle. Tech support informed me that to use a standard bottle w/o a self-piercing membrane I should go to Amazon to purchase caps and membranes to turn the bottles into one which could be used in this poorly designed product. If you try to place an open bottle on the dispenser you end up with water on the walls,floor and dispenser because of a minimal amount of clearance for the bottle spout.n Great home water cooler! I purchased this water cooler in May because I didn't like the taste of my tap water and individual bottles of water were inconvenient. My dispenser delivers cold water quite fast and the amount of time it takes to chill the water is quick too. Now when the family comes over for a get together everyone drinks my water! The only drawback is the spike. I found replacement bottle caps on line that allow me to swap the bottle without spills but it would have been nice if there were a couple in the box! Overall, I'm very pleased with my dispenser and recommend it to all my friends!n Slow dispenser This cooler dispenses water so slowly I barely use it. It looks good and the water comes out cold, but literally it takes like a full minute to fill up a small glassn We had this cooler for 1 year and has developed a leak.

I bought my Glacier Bay water dispenser about 5 1/2 years ago and it worked just great for me during that time. However, like so many others, the dispenser stopped cooling the water. For me, this occurred at that 5 1/2 year mark. Being a guy who likes to repair stuff, I went through a process of You Tube water dispenser repair videos, etc, culminating in a call to the GHP Group, who supplies or makes Glacier Bay and Vitapur (same unit with different names) water dispensers and they told me that there are no parts available and no repair options. So I will have to throw it out and buy some other unit. My problems with this unit is the lack of a way to repair the unit and also an obvious lack of reliability - In the reviews, I see some units lasting a year, three years, and mine 5 1/2 years.

I was expecting the unit to be heavier because of the on board cooling compressor but at only 43 lbs. It's light enough for anyone to move around and setup. The four feet are not adjustable so it's important that the unit be positioned on a flat and level surface. n Unpacking the accessories I found the \"drip tray\" which is really a drip reservoir. It's about an 1-1/2 in. deep with a red \"bobber\" which I assume is an indicator of when the reservoir needs to be emptied. The unit snaps into place easily on the front of the machine. The unit ships with 1 filter, 1 extra filter flushing adapter, 1 adapter with shut-off valve and 1 anti-tip bracket. The included filter is rated for 1500 gallons or six months. There's a red indicator light that will blink when its time to change the filter. Home Depot has the replacement filter, model \"Avalon Replacement Filter For Bottleless Water Coolers A4FILTER\" but I found them for less on a popular auction site. There's also a built-in \"Self-Cleaning / Sanitizing\" button that should be activated weekly. It takes 90 minutes to run through the cycle. n Installation is easy as long as you have a sink and a 15 amp grounded outlet nearby. The included adapter goes between the cold water supply line and the cold water line to the faucet. The 1/4 in. line to the unit pushes onto the \"T\" adapter and is secured by tightening the nut. I had an existing \"T\" fitting already installed from an ice machine I no longer needed so I used it. The filter needs to be flushed, for about 5 minutes, using the extra flushing adapter before it's twisted into place on the unit. Connect the hose to the filter, plug in the electrical cord and it's done. n It takes about an hour for the cold water to reach optimal temperature and about 15 minutes for the hot water (about 185 degrees). I found that the cold water is crisp enough that, for me, ice is not needed and the hot is perfect for tea or instant coffee. I like them very hot. n One Year Limited Warranty for Avalon Water Coolers.This warranty extends only to the original purchaser of the product and lasts for one (1) year from the date of original purchase or until the original purchaser of the product sells or transfers the product, whichever first occurs.

All parts and hose were provided . The 3/8 line and fitting were snug and with no leaks. Filter information was provided along with where to get replacement. The temperature setting are very accurate too. Pros: Convenient, Easy to Clean, Easy to Use, Light Weight, Looks Great, Portablen We just purchased this electric counter-top water dispenser We just purchased this electric counter-top water dispenser to replace our fridge water dispenser. I love the fact that it has 3 temperatures, and the area to place bottles underneath is large and can accommodate most bottles. Living in Phoenix, we need to drink water all the time, so we really use this alot. So far, it has held up well and works great! Pros: Looks Great, Nice Design Cons: Difficult to Cleann MUCH better than water delivery service I've been looking for options for filtered water and was thinking about the large cooler with water delivery service, but when this popped up for me to try out, I jumped at the opportunity. The idea makes so much sense! Not dealing with water delivery, having cold/hot filtered water right on my counter. I love that. A lot of people are saying that hookup is really easy, but for me I couldn't figure it out on my own so I had a guy come over to install it. It's a little taller than I thought but I have the perfect spot for it so it works out. The water flow is similar to that of the large coolers that are at the office and it dispenses clean tasting water. I had to flush it out before using because it has this plastic or chemical taste at first. So make sure you do that first. The hot water dispenses water similar to my Nespresso machine temperature. I use it for tea, oatmeal, soup etc. Really handy. So far I'm loving this option FAR more than dealing with water delivery. This just makes so much sense. Would be perfect for any type space. Highly recommend!nRead Less it's a beautiful countertop water cooler. Good for doctor of It's a beautiful unit.

Premium Hot/Cold Top Loading Countertop Water Cooler with Child Safety Lock is a great addition to both our kitchen and home office.

One thing I really like is the ability to select if you want the hot water or cold water features on or off. So for example in the winter I don't really need chilled water so I can just shut that feature off and there will be not wasted electricity cooling the water I won't use. You may also need to be strategic about where you place this. Obviously you need power but the height of the unit also means a counter top may make it difficult to load new water jugs due to the height and strength needed to hoist one up. But I'll take that added step to get hot/cold water any day!n A water cooler is purchase well worth making, for those who do not have water in their refrigerat... A water cooler is purchase well worth making, for those who do not have water in their refrigerator door or prefer the benefits of bottled water. The cooler keeps cold water available with just the touch of a button. It also has a button for room temperature water and a button for hot water. This particular cooler is nice that it has separate on off switches because I don't want to use energy to keep hot water. The cooler is compatible with 3 gallon (my choice for easy handling) or 5 gallon bottles. I really like that the cooler does not drip after you pour a glass; however, the drip tray is a nice feature just in case. I have my cooler ontop of a steel shelving stand and it worked out great.nRead Less The Avalon counter-top water cooler is ideal for providing instant hot or cold water for any type... The Avalon counter-top water cooler is ideal for providing instant hot or cold water for any type of beverage. It also provides water at room temperature if desired. It also has a child safety lock to prevent accidental use of the hot water. I found no problem lifting a water jug up to the counter and the water dispenser was very stable. I also found the units compressor to operate quietly.n Great product to have with a very manageable footprint for those that don't have a lot of space i... Great product to have with a very manageable footprint for those that don't have a lot of space in their kitchen area. Countertop size is a huge plus and with ease of use, the Avalon premium hot/cold top loading water cooler with child safety lock makes it a very practical and attractive appliance. We installed it in our game room (man cave as my hubby refers to it) which helps in reducing traffic to the kitchen area and keeping it a little more uncluttered. Easy install, not overly bulky, keeps water nice and cold and of course dispenses hot water. Love this unit.n This little water cooler is great for us as we are on a well and we have always used bottled wate... This little water cooler is great for us as we are on a well and we have always used bottled water for drinking because you just can't be 100% sure of what the quality of the well water is. Now on a hot day we can get cold, clean water without needing to refrigerate bottles of water. It's a compact unit and it looks great. It is energy star rated and it has a child safety lock to prevent youngsters from getting injured by hot water. You have the choice of hot, room temperature or cold water.n 4 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern 4 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern Only had it for one month as of review post.

Only issue is that it's a bit close to the ground and I had to make a little stand for it to be higher and I would have liked a way to adjust the temperatures of the hot and cold, but there are convenient switches it you don't need the chilling or heating over long stretches of time which is our case.n Love it.

Looks great, runs quietly and easy to set up.n Good Product, Bad Manual Good product, except the manufacturer should revise the instruction manual to make clear how to use the intake pipe. I wanted to use (smaller) 3 gallon jugs, and since the pipe was too long to fit the top of the jugs, I sawed off excess length. Later I found out (without any help from the manual) that the top of the intake pipe DIDN'T HAVE TO fit the jug securely to function. Now I cannot use bigger jugs because I sawed off the pipe. All this was easily avoided if the instructions had been clearer.n Great cooler and hot water heater Great cooler and hot water heater. The only thing I do not like about it is that the room temperature water comes out quite slow since it has to pump it from the jug. Other than that it works great.

The bottom portion of the cooler has stylish rounded corners. The cooler is packaged very nicely & surrounded with Styrofoam and wrapped in plastic. The instructions read very easy!

I would strongly recommend to anyone looking for a more stylish water cooler / dispenser! A+n This is a great top load water dispenser. This is a very nice addition to any area where hot, c... This is a great top load water dispenser. This is a very nice addition to any area where hot, cold and room temperature water is needed. We use this in our shops warm bay. Since we use this area year round we can have hot water for lunchtime instant noodles or instant soups and tea to warm up in the wintertime. In summer we have both cool room temperature water and ice cold for a very refreshing drink on a hot day. n The unit dispenses about 3 cups of hot water in about two minutes for soups, teas or anything that needs near boiling water. The buttons for the hot, cool and cold water are nice and large making them easy to push and hold. The water dispensing area is large enough to hold almost any size of drink container. n We use a 5 gallon glass carboy for our water. Since we now have very good filtered well water in the house as well as the shop, we just keep cleaning and refilling the carboy. This makes water cost for us almost zero since glass is easy to clean. Loading the unit is very easy when using store bought water five gallon carboys. Just remove the tape covering the very center of the cap and slide the water jug over the coolers center pin. It's really very easy and there is no mess.n The water dispenser is very quiet when cooling and heating water. This is great if your kitchen is adjacent to your family room.n I can't say enough about having hot and cold water available all the time. Itu2019s also a great thing to have for company. I can see that this would be a great investment for most kitchens since the cost of 5 gallons of water is a fraction of the cost of other bottled water. This one cooler will keep many thousands of used water bottles out of landfills.nRead Less We have rented a dispenser from the water company for years. Although it is only a few dollars p... We have rented a dispenser from the water company for years. Although it is only a few dollars per month, it adds up, so I got this dispenser and now we only purchase the water bottles. I love that it has three options - hot, room temp, and cold. The hot is pretty hot and works fine right from the machine for my hot tea. The cold is icy cold. The bottles don't \"burp\" as loudly on this dispenser and so far there hasn't been a single drip or anything to clean up. There was no assembly required. There are cleaning instructions but I haven't had to do that yet. It sits in a corner out of the way and the top mounted buttons keep small kids from using it without help.n The finish on the unit looks great.

This unit does not have storage under the unit even though it states it does in description. One of the best features on this unit is that if you are not going to use all the time you can turn off the heating and cooling unit separately by using the two switches on the side. I know some people may be concerned about the amount of electricity used by the dispenser but once the water is heated and cooled it stops running so the electricity to run will be minimal. When the unit is running it is very quiet so no worries about that. I was curious just how many cups of hot water you could get at a time so I put it to the test. The first two cups come out very hot but by the third cup you could tell a difference. We use in a summer home and was surprised out just how quick you become accustom to having cold water and hot water at the touch of a button and you don't have the waste of all the individual water bottles and taking up space in your fridge. Highly recommend for the home or office.nRead Less The Avalon 3 temperature water cooler is a great addition to any home. I set mine up in the kitch... The Avalon 3 temperature water cooler is a great addition to any home. I set mine up in the kitchen and it was very simple to set up and surprisingly light weight. The best feature for me is the 3 temperatures ,especially the hot water dispenser as this makes baking and instant recipes a breeze. The cold water dispenser should help to cut down on the expense of individual bottled water. Its lean black and chrome design is modern enough to match any kitchen decor.n Great looking water cooler for a small office. The water cooler dispenses ice cold water, however... Great looking water cooler for a small office. The water cooler dispenses ice cold water, however the hot water dispenser isn't quite hot enough for more than your average cup of tea. It could go a little hotter, but there's no way to adjust the temperature on the cooler itself. The area under the spigot could be a little larger as it doesn't accommodate larger containers.n Beautifully designed water dispenser that has all the buttons on the top instead of typically on... Beautifully designed water dispenser that has all the buttons on the top instead of typically on the front. The 3 operational buttons are larger and easy to depress, the stream of water is forceful so there is less wait time, The hot button has a red switch that slides over to one side then you press down as usual. It gives room temperature water which is great when your preparing a microwave meal that requires adding water (like stuffing) but you dont want to use faucet water if your on a well system like many people are. On the sides there are handles to make moving it easier -most coolers do not have this feature & there are cold & hot water shut off switches to save energy if for instance you dont want to use the hot/cold water for awhile. This water cooler looks very cutting edge with its updated style & would look good in a business setting, i put it in my vacation home kitchen and its fine, i get compliments on it.nRead Less I got the Avalon top loading water cooler to replace a 12 year old unit we were using.

According to the specs, the hot is 180 degrees and the cold is 47 degrees. I didn't use a thermometer but the hot is hot enough to make tea and instant coffee.

This sleek water cooler is small and easy for to put anywhere in your home or business. It has hot, cold, or room temperature water options. The cooler can handle a three (3) or five (5) gallon bottle. The instructions are easy to read and understand. The water is hot enough to make instant coffee, hot tea, or any other item you wish to start off hot. The cold water is cold as if you took out of your refrigerator. I would recommend purchasing this water cooler over bottled water. It will save you money in the long run.n I purchased the Avalon Top Loading Water Cooler Dispenser in Stainless Steel to have the convenie... I purchased the Avalon Top Loading Water Cooler Dispenser in Stainless Steel to have the convenience of immediate access to different water temperatures all year round. The ease of use by simply selecting a spout to receive hot or cold water for whatever beverage you choose at the time is very handy. Since it is child safe even the kids can get their own cold water but adult supervision is required for the hot water unit. This is a great advantage to parents so that no child is hurt when selecting hot water to make tea or hot chocolate. The red (hot water) safety button is pushed to the side and then pressed down to activate the hot water spout while the other buttons are simply pressed down. This is a beautiful stainless steel dispenser that looks like a lovely appliance and fits very well into my kitchen décor. The cold water provides great cold water and the hot water provides a good 180 degree temperature. What I like is the storage cabinet capability that allows you to store another water bottle in the bottom. If you like having the convenience of having immediate access to hot or cold water any time of day or night, this unit is for you. It doesnu2019t get much better than that. Highly recommend this dispenser.nRead Less Nice design, compact, how water is hot enough to brew tea. Cold water is nice and chilly. Machine...

We've been doing bottled water and more than a little bit of soda. I decided to kick the soda habit so started drinking more water. I feel really bad burning through so many bottles, even with recycling, plus the costs. I decided to get a water cooler. Going into it I knew I wanted instant hot water and a bottom loader. I did a good bit of research that led to this unit. Most the brands have as many 1 star as 5 star reviews, often worse. The big review articles all pointed to this brand (though a different model).

Returned from lunch to find water on the floor. Noticed a small steady stream of water coming out of the internal cabinetry. Followed the instructions to remove the top bottle support cover and found a mangled gasket that was not sealing correctly. See photo. Put it back together and returned to HD to swap it out for another one. Five minutes after installing a different 5 gal water bottle on the new unit it also started to leak. Removed the bottle support collar and found the same gasket disfigured, just not as bad as the first one. Persistence sometimes pays off so hopefully third time is the charm as it is sleek and looks nice in my office.nRead Less 1 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern Dispenser is nice but the space under the faucets is so short we can't even get a mason jar or ou... Dispenser is nice but the space under the faucets is so short we can't even get a mason jar or our water bottles under it. Also the cooler is not good for using a water filtering unit on the top. When you take the baffle out that pierces a filled water bottle, it leaves a lot of open space where your nice clean water is to go. There are two little \"holes\" that will allow germs etc. into the water. I had to fill these holes and make some other modifications so we could use our Pur water unit on the top. Having said this, so far it is working as expected.n 4 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern This does not work as expected.

The buttons are very hard to push for the average person especially a child. (This is coming from a 6'2'' 300+lb man). It is smaller than the average cooler.

The unit is really quiet when heating water (I used to have to turn the heating element off on the prior dispenser because it was quite noisy). I did take the top panel screws out to clean it according to directions in manual before first use but I could not get the top off and it did look quite complicated so I took a chance on using it the way it came.

A great sturdy product that acts just like a floor stand, but smaller.n I was excited to receive the Avalon Premium Hot/Cold Top Loading Countertop Water Cooler Dispense... I was excited to receive the Avalon Premium Hot/Cold Top Loading Countertop Water Cooler Dispenser with Child Safety Lock, White. It is a large countertop unit, and seems well made except for the water paddles and child safety lock, which are rather flimsy plastic. I decided to buy a 3 gallon bottle to make loading easier and was able to load with only a small amount of spillage. I waited overnight to test the water temps and, using a thermometer, found that the hot water is 160 degrees, which is above the AZ health standards for food which is 140 degrees, but is lower than I expected. The cold spout delivers 45 degree water, while tap water locally is 80 degrees, so it is cold enough if drinking immediately, as you would at a water cooler at work, but warms quickly. Was it worth the expense? For situations where a fairly hot and cold drinking water are not available, yes. From a standpoint of reducing the amount of plastic water bottles in the landfill, yes. For me, no.nRead Less I got this because I had a smaller space available and didn't want the bulk of the floor model. ... I got this because I had a smaller space available and didn't want the bulk of the floor model. This unit is roughly 12\"W x 12\"L x 19\"H (without the bottle) so it's a good fit for the corner of my counter in the basement (no cabinets above it). In terms of functionality, it more or less does what it says - provides you cold or hot water quickly. The hot water isn't instantaneous, but it is quicker than a microwave (without the hot cup!) or a stove top tea kettle. Just a nice little luxury to have.n Love love love my water cooler hot water for my ...

What I like about this hot and cold water dispenser is that it sits on top of a counter and does not take up floor space. It does not need a stand like the floor models and is very compact but perfectly sized for our smaller space. We use a lot less small plastic water bottles which is a good thing for the environment. We can make a cup of hot tea, hot chocolate or instant soup by using the hot water dispenser-very convenient.

Me and my wife have talked about getting a water cooler for her craft shop because sometimes she needs water for her projects and sometimes for a drink of cold water and never thought how great it would be to have hot water also , so when we saw this counter top water cooler dispenser that also dispenses hot water , we decided to go for this model and liked it so much we also got one for our house also and they provide nice cold water and very hot water and even though we do not have any young children , the child safety lock is a plus.n I really like this water dispenser.

I keep it at work and it's very handy to have around.n One of the best features is how attractive it is. It just looks like quality and it's something I wouldn't mind having in my kitchen or somewhere else in the home.n I also like the ability to turn the heating or cooling functions off. The only issue is that it then takes a while to heat or cool. But that's OK. It gets water hot enough for a cup of noodles or tea/coffee and cool enough to be very refreshing on a hot day.n It's also handy that it works with 3 or 5 gallon bottles. The carry handles are a plus, too.n All in all this thing is a great value if you're looking for a hot/cold water dispenser. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this unit.nRead Less This water dispenser is very easy to use. The directions are good and it sets up and ready for us... This water dispenser is very easy to use.

There is a switch on the side of the unit so you can turn off or on the cold or hot water and save power. The unit has handles on the sides for easy carrying. It can be used with a 3 or 5 gallon water bottle but each gallon is 8.34 pounds. There is a water drain on the back of the unit.

We had to leave our $350 water cooler behind during our last move, so I wanted something under $100 that was still reliable for every-day use.n I found this in store, and figured it was worth a shot. It came with one free bottle, and I believe I received a discount on any additional bottles I bought at the same time, plus a military discount on top of that (thanks, Home Depot!). It's smaller/shorter than more expensive coolers, but this proved to be a plus - it fits neatly in the corner of our kitchen, and it's short enough for my four-year-old to reach without assistance. We keep a small plastic tumbler on the drip tray so he can get himself water - our previous cooler was too tall and he needed our help to reach, but now he's able to reach whenever he wants. I also appreciate the push-button for the hot water (which most coolers seems to have now), which is tricky enough to stop him from accidentally accessing it, but easy for adults to use when needed. By the way, the hot water temperature is perfect for tea or instant coffee!n The cold water button does stick occasionally (a problem I've experienced with every single water cooler I've ever owned) but it's the result of sugary or sticky substances getting inside the mechanism - from making and dripping sugary drinks onto the button, from sticky hands, and occasionally from getting too humid during the summer. To fix this, I use a wet rag or sponge to squeeze clean water over the button, then use a q-tip to clean in between the crevices. I keep an empty mixing bowl underneath the spigot to catch the water so it's not wasted (and doesn't spill all over the floor). I also clean the spigots with clean water (no cleaning solution - this can contaminate the water) and a q-tip every few months, which is something you should do for any water cooler.n We've had this for nearly two years now, and I'm pleasantly surprised at how well it's held up to daily heavy use. I've recommended it numerous times, and two of our neighbors now own it and love it. We're due to move soon and I'd be surprised if it came with us, so if it doesn't, I'll definitely be buying another one as soon as we move in!nRead Less Junk dont waste money Buttons leak junk I have 2 no good ones and home depot wont refund me or credit my accountn Solid Product Just purchased this cooler - out of the box intact and doing what a cooler should - serving chilled water reliably.

Historically, I have used only bottled water coolers in the home. A few weeks ago, I moved into a large, single-family home where we were using a Brita filter to have drinking water. Since refilling five gallon water bottles is just not financially viable for us, I decided to splurge on this countertop bottleless water cooler and I couldn't be happier. I had my plumber come and install it at the little mini bar at our home and it was up and running in less than an hour.n This Avalon countertop water dispenser has more features than others on the market. It dispenses ... This Avalon countertop water dispenser has more features than others on the market. It dispenses cold water at forty seven degrees and hot water at one hundred and sixty eight degrees. Cold enough to drink without adding ice and hot enough to make coffee, tea, instant soup etc. The best part is that no more lugging heavy water bottles from the store and then having to return the empties.There is not even a refilling tank on the top.n What this has is a self cleaning system and a water filter. The self cleaning feature has instructions in the booklet about how to clean every three months. The water filter ( one filter included ) improves taste, removes odors, chlorine, lead, and cysts. It is recommended to change filter approximately every six months or 1500 gallons. I go by the taste test. When it starts having any taste, that's when I change it.n The water is connected directly to the under counter water line, so refilling is not necessary.There is a nightlight and safety switch on the hot water dispenser. The paddles are just like the ones on refrigerators. This unit also comes in white. It is energy star approved.nRead Less Have this installed in our new office.

First off it is beautiful! It as compact as possible for what it performs and even though it claims some counter space it doesn't take up nearly as much space as full size water cooler. Second it is BOTTLELESS that means no running out to pick up water and all the hassle entailed. If you are concerned about the water quality I purchased the basic water purification system. Our city water is almost undrinkable from the bad taste and chlorine odor. This system delivers pure and amazing water. My kids are drinking a lot more water now. For me the third and best feature is the hot water function. For us this was a big purchase and one of the ways I rationalized this purchase was we needed a new coffee maker. We had a pod system but because of our poor water quality it only lasted a year (this is typical for coffee makers in our house) Dreading going back to the stove top which takes too long we purchased this water dispenser. I can't begin to describe the amazing feeling of just running water into your french press and having coffee in seconds. Now this leads me to really the best reason of all to buy this product. I had previously and hastily reviewed this product at only 2 stars. If i'm honest that wasn't fair but despite all of the great features of this product I was disappointed with the hot water. A cup of tea or coffee just wasn't quite hot enough and I'll say again I was disappointed.nRead Less hot water takes too long and quantity is not sufficient and noisy, hot water takes too long and quantity is not sufficient and noisy,n COOLER IS EASY TO LOAD, NO MORE SPILLING WATER FROM THE TOP LOADER KIND.

This seems to be a pretty good dispenser. The cold water is cold and the hot water comes out hot (after waiting for it to heat). I am not impressed by the door.

I've had a Kentwood water dispenser for a while that I gave it up for this unit when I saw it at Home Depot. Especially when I saw that it also dispenses room temperature water - the Kentwood dispenser does not dispense room temperature water, but does dispense very HOT water. This unit does the job in dispensing the cold and room temperature water but the hot water takes a couple of minutes to heat up, apparently to save power - I'm not too thrilled about this. I'm not sure if there is a setting to keep the water hot all the time but apparently it shuts off to save energy. Also, there is usually plenty of water left in the bottle that doesn't dispense so I have to pull the bottle out and empty the remainder of the water and put in a new bottle. Again, not sure if there is a setting or some kind of adjustment for this. The instructions that came with this unit does not give you any insight on either of these minor inconveniences. For this reason I gave it 3 stars. If it turns out I can get INSTANT HOT WATER without waiting, and don't have to change the water bottle when there is plenty of water left in the bottle, I would have given it at least 4 stars.nRead Less Love this bottom feed water cooler.

FYI- I am experiencing problems with the water dispensing buttons. The cold button became stuck and one of the plastic \"nubs\" on the shaft that guides it broke off. It needs to be replaced. My unit is out of warranty. I called Home Depot customer service to order a new button. Home Depot called the company that manufactures the unit and then informed me that THERE ARE NO REPLACEMENT PARTS of any kind for the unit. Of course, had it still be under warranty, it would have been replaced. Since it wasn't, the only solution is to trash it and buy another one. I find it hard to believe that a water dispenser costing over $200 became trash in a little over a year and that Home Depot knowingly sells a product that can't be repaired, only replaced. Note: The water cooler that the Glacier Bay replaced was 25+ years old and still going strong.

The Avaion Water Cooler is the answer. We have received a number of positive responses for this in place of the drinking fountain. The unit looks nice and is holding up well.

I hate having to heat water for my tea and wouldn't dream of microwaving it, which changes the taste, so having hot water available is great!

The area where the water is dispensed is very spacious and accommodates larger or taller containers. There is a child safety lock which is great for preventing burns on little hands!!

Avalon \"Bottleless\" water dispenser is super! We chose this model because we have an Avalon bottom feed dispenser in our kitchen, and love it. This model attaches to your main water supply just like an ice maker on a fridge would attach. All required hoses and fittings are included. We attached ours under the sink in our basement in-law apartment. A replaceable carbon activated filter in used to filter tap water. Recommended to change approx. every 6 months. The hot water has a child safety lock and both hot and cold taps have a convenient push-paddle to dispense water. Hot water comes out hot enough for tea, coffee, hot chocolate and more. Cold comes out cold enough that you don't need ice cubes. Water dispenses much faster than our refrigerator and that's why we got this model. It also features a self-cleaning mode. A convenient night light is included. It is energy star rated. A side note to the manufacturer; there are a few text errors on the fine print on the carton. \"Innovation\" is spelled incorrectly, \"Innvaton.\" \"There is a built-in night....\" the word \"light\" is missing. It incorrectly states that this model is a bottom loading. We noticed these same errors on the carton of the first model. Perhaps the maker doesn't have proof readers, so I'm helping them out!

What I really like about this water dispenser is that I donu2019t have to drill a hole into my granite countertop, the is no need of a drinking faucet. Moreover, since it a standalone, it will not take up space in my counter. The design and size is perfect for office and home use. The installation of this machine was very easy, only requiring a small wrench and thread sealant tape. There is no pipe cutting, unless you want the water inlet shortened. After completing the installation, I opened all the valves and found no leaks. Great design and easy instruction!Furthermore, the water from the dispenser tasted a lot better than the water from the faucet. The temperature of the cold water is very refreshing. My family enjoys drinking teas and the hot water dispenser works perfectly for that purpose.

I can give my family, including my loved doggies, a cold refreshing drink without the mess from bottled water. I can also use the hot water to make myself a nice cup of tea. It is plenty hot for the tea. I am drinking my tea and honey as I write this review. No doubt this unit will receive a lot of use! n Installation is fairly simple. I easily used the shut off under the sink. Before you even think about the installation read the instructions and be sure of your clearances for the unit. I also flushed out the water line as per the instructions. I have found anytime you disturb a water line you will have sediment break free and it can cause many issues. Luckily I also had power close by and easily accessible. I think it is an excellent idea to use the optional anti tip bracket! We are building a new house and I have noted to have the plumber and electrician install dedicated lines for this unit. n If your like me you will occasionally enjoy a drink of water during the night. The night light makes this possible without needing to turn on the house light! The self cleaning feature is a huge plus! n It also has a safety lockout on the hot water side to prevent young children from accidental injury. We donu2019t have any children but the our big dogs are already trying to figure out how they can get their own water. Laugh but I am very serious! Our German Shepherd is incredibly smart and I can see him using his nose to poke the water on. n Bottom line is this unit is an incredibly useful appliance! I have found zero negatives and it earns a five star rating!

The safety switch on the hot water prevents little hands from getting scalded if used in a home or daycare. While the unit provides an anchor bracket on the back to fasten it to the floor, I found that the unit is solid enough to place anywhere and still be quite sturdy. If you are looking for the most bang for your buck, this is the unit for you.nRead Less This water dispenser sets up in minutes and can find a home in any corner of any room you choose ... This water dispenser sets up in minutes and can find a home in any corner of any room you choose to put it in. Dispenser puts out cold and hiot water both by means of any easy to use color coordinated paddle, red for hot blue for cold. The hot water has s lock on it to prevent little kids from getting scolded which I appreciate having a one year old. A lock for the cold paddle would of been equally nice having a child so young that likes to push things in to avoid unnecessary spills by wandering little hands. Great dispenser though, delivers as a water dispenser should but with added safety features a basic dispenser would not have.n Very convienient This top loading water dispenser is great for the kitchen, break room or a man-cave. Setup only took a few minutes and it was ready to use. One of the nice features about this cooler is you can just press the cup against the back paddle to fill it for the cold water. The Hot water has a child safety feature so there are no accidental burns. This water cooler is also Energy Star certified.n Nice Water Cooler - A Little Noisy The Avalon Top Loading Water Cooler has a slim and compact design, which takes up little room, no matter where you place it. The cooler can provide cold or hot water with ample pressure, which is delivered in a steady stream. There are three indication lights located above the hot and cold water dispensers. The first is yellow, which indicates that the power Is turned on. The middle light turns red when it is heating the hot water. Finally, the third turns blue when it is cooling the water. n On the back of the water cooler, along the top left side, you will see two switches (refer to the third picture).One switch turns the power on to the unit and the second switch controls whether or not you would like to turn on the hot water feature. n You don't have to worry about your children getting scolded with hot water. In order to use the hot water you have to push down a red tab, which is located on top of the hot water dispenser. This is a great safety feature.n The only negative about this unit is that it can tend to get a little noisy when it is heating or cooling the water. It isn't excessively loud however you can definitely hear the compressor cycle on and off which provides a low humming noise in the background.nRead Less What a great counter top unit!

Especially if you don't have an in fridge water dispenser....which many of us don't have because they ruin the look of our fridge. This unit can sit any where on your counter or on a cart as so desired, and you can have cold / hot or room temp water any time you like. I am using it out side on the patio so there is no need to go into the house every time I need cold water. Just keep a stack of plastic glasses in the cabinet under the unit, and life is good! Clean water all the time, and no trip to the kitchen! I think the hot water feature is amazing....not having to nuke a cup of water every time I want a hot drink.

Thumbs up for the easy, finger-tip availability of cold filtered water. Or filtered hot water. Or filtered water at room temperature. (I was surprised that a few guests actually prefer to drink their water at room temperature.)n This appliance requires surprisingly little counter space. The stainless steel looks modern and blends well with my white cabinets.n The water dispenser is easy to use: select cold or room temperature and how much you want. If in doubt about how much you need, just press and hold the \"dispense\" button and water will flow continuously.n When you select hot water, only the \"dispense\" button works. This is explained as a \"safety feature.\"n Installation on the counter top is easy. Put it in place, install the drip tray, plug it into a wall outlet, and connect a water line. n It's the \"connect the water line\" that requires the efforts of an advanced DIYer. I placed my dispenser next to the refrigerator and split the feed for the ice maker. Otherwise I would have had to drill holes and fish plastic tubing through walls and cabinets.n All the parts are included in the kit for running the water line. This includes tubing and a shut-off valve.nRead Less I am very mechanically inclined, but when I first opened the Electric Counter-top Water Cooler/He... I am very mechanically inclined, but when I first opened the Electric Counter-top Water Cooler/Heater box, I was a bit apprehensive about doing the installation myself! I read over the instructions, looked at the pictures and reviewed all the parts that came with the item many times before starting. I thought I would need to purchase a special fitting to make the water connection to my water supply, but realized that the manufacturer had addressed all my needs. The small water shut-off valve provided has a feature where the 1/4\" poly ethylene tubing attaches. In order to make that \"slip on\" attachment, I first ran the hot water over the end of the tubing to soften it a bit before pressing it onto the valve. I then attached the new valve to the existing cold shut-off valve and reconnected the flex tube going to the faucet. I then drilled holes in the adjoining cabinet to run the tubing. I drilled a hole in the counter top to bring the line up to the location I had selected for the hot/cold water dispenser. In retrospect, I should have starting fishing the 1/4\" PE tubing from the counter top and then work my way toward the new valve THEN connected the tubing to the sink supply. Make sure before connecting the new water supply to the unit to flush the filters as directed to purge any loose filter media left over from the manufacturing process. With the \"ELECTRIC COUNTERTOP BOTTLELESS WATER COOLER WATER DISPENSER - 3 TEMPERATURE, UV CLEANING, 3 DISPENSING VOLUMES\" completely installed, we are enjoying both cool and hot \"instant\" water for our drinking. A FOOT NOTE: when locating the counter top 1/4\" water line hole, be very careful to account for the fact that cabinetry has a wooden support board running horizontally against the top back of the cabinet which provides counter support and strength to the cabinet. They are likely to be 3/4\" thick. Allow for this wood when drilling the hole. If you don't, you will be drilling through the wood and possibly creating more work. With natural stone counter tops, you don't want to \"RE-DRILL\"!!!nRead Less excited Our company is excited for the new machines!n Great Cooler, 3 Temps 3 settings so you can make your drink the way you need it, You put a tea c...

There's also the fact that you'll never have to carry a 5 gallon jug of water again.nRead Less This is a great product. I bought it because I live in the south and during the long hot summers... This is a great product. I bought it because I live in the south and during the long hot summers the cold water from the tap in our house never gets cold.

I had installed this water dispenser about a week ago and took my time to really feel it out as it is currently meant to replace my Primo hot/cold bottled water dispenser. The look and feel of this unit is top notch. The buttons appear to be capacative touch where no pressure is required for it to determine which button you're pressing. I used a measuring cup to see how accurate the unit is as far as dispensing the appropriate amount of water and verified the large equals 10oz, med equals 8oz, and small equals 6oz. Hot water comes out at a piping hot 151F, while cold water was measured at 53F. While 53 is much colder than room temperature, I wish it could be colder (my Primo chills the water down to 48F). As far as The taste of the water- I tried my own makeshift taste test with my family and it seems that nobody could tell the difference between the Alhambra bottled water vs the Avalon filtered water. The filter units are rated to last 1500 gallons before replacement. That will basically replace 300 5 gallon Alhambra water jugs. If you're paying for a bottled water delivery service, this until will more than pay for itself in a short amount of time. Overall, I'm very happy with this unit and have actually cancelled my Alhambra water subscription.nRead Less I love the appearance of this water cooler/heater.

I like the stainless-steel faceplate on this with a black body - it works in almost any kitchen decor. I tested the hot water: it dispenses at an impressive 185 degrees F. The cold side, about 2 hours after being plugged in and charged with a 5 gallon water bottle, was 45 degrees F. I do notice that the refrigeration unit has u201chumu201d in my otherwise quiet kitchen. The manual says if it is loud, the unit needs to be u201cmounted on a placid firm surfaceu201d - I had to look that up. It means tranquil, peaceful. They want you to mount it on a stable surface that does not itself have a rattle, such as a 4-legged table with one leg slightly shorter. It comes with a mounting bracket to help secure it to wood, which is also a safety feature, to ensure a child doesnu2019t pull the cooler over on herself. Thereu2019s an interlock on the hot-water dispenser as well, since it is a scalding output.If the hum is bothersome, this unit has two switches on the side: one controls the hot water heater, the other controls the chiller. I can simply turn off the chiller, water still dispenses, and the hum is gone, while I still enjoy the hot water. A note on dimensions: when fitted with a 5-gallon water bottle, this unit stands 35.75 inches tall. Without the water bottle, itu2019s actually 20.5 inches tall including the water bottle seating ring. The product spec says 19 inches tall. Overall, an attractive highly functional unit. Friends like it, and I recommend it.nRead Less I got this water dispenser thinking we would use it in the kitchen as a supplement to our reverse... I got this water dispenser thinking we would use it in the kitchen as a supplement to our reverse osmosis system (which is slow to fill larger water needs). We are on well water and I thought it would be healthier to use bottled water. Once unpackaged I realized the unit took up too much counter space for our use. Given that we already use a Keurig coffee maker (that can make hot water instantly) I moved the Avalon water unit to the basement workshop; and am happy with it in that location. This water dispenser would be ideal for an office setting/lunch room area but I can not recommend it for a kitchen (especially smaller kitchen with limited counter space.) I do like the function buttons: large and easy to read. Heats and cools water as advertised. The dispenser has a modern look and will fit in most kitchen decors (even more so in an office setting). The manufacturer recommends a thorough cleaning every three months, and while this makes sense some users may find this to be a hassle. I should mention that the unit will accommodate 3 and 5 gallon bottles ...a plus for me as I like the smaller bottle (easier to lift and insert into the bottle receptacle. I would recommend the Avalon for any office/work area.nRead Less This is a very nice stylish hot and cold model with a room temp button as well. It does have a re... This is a very nice stylish hot and cold model with a room temp button as well. It does have a refrigerator hum from the compressor and both the hot and cold can be independently turned on or off with separate power switches. Being on a counter, there is a higher lift when replacing the water jug. And having it as high as my head is not practical on my kitchen counter, so I will need to find a lower table to put it on. Heats and chills relatively quickly. The hot is near boiling for quick tea, coffee or soups. The cold was nicely chilled, but not as cold as water from my refrigerator. There are no settings for adjustment of the temperatures. Very nice, but some room for improvement. I would only recommend this model if you don't have room for a floor standing unit where you can put the water in the bottom of the unit. Changing jugs will be a challenge depending on the height of your countertop. The water jug is not included. There are also two carry hands on each side to make moving safer. If you don't mind putting a screw into your countertop, there is also a bracket to attach the unit to the counter to avoid tipping. I had a granite counter, so that was not an option, and the feet on the bottom were sturdy and I did not have any issues with stability.nRead Less Superb!

Hot water is steaming hot, cold water is nice and chilly. Be advised, the hot and cold lights on the front turn on and off by themselves, depending on whether the heating or cooling units are actively heating or cooling or not because the water is already at the desired temperature. UPDATE: You wouldn't think it, but having hot water on hand at all times has dramatically decreased my coffee consumption in favor of drinking more tea. So, added benefit.n Bang for your dollar I see a lot of bad reviews for this product. It's a shame because it is a good machine for home use. A little noisy when it filters through the refrigeration coils but not unbearable. The cold setting is easily accessible and once you find the right setting it stays constant. The blue display lights are seriously cool. If you want a Porshce on a Honda budget then the buyer should save their money until they can afford a $500 + unit. Trust me, not necessary. We are 5 in our family and we go through water as if it was........water.n Looks great This water dispenser is a great addition to my office suite. It is very sleek and stylish. Holds three, four or five gallon jugs of water. It is very easy to adjust for any of the three sizes. Since it is a bottom load dispenser it means you don't have to worry about lifting the water up over the dispenser. Simply put the line in the water jug and slide the just into place. Then just close the door. This dispenser does hot, cold or room temperature water.n Good value for the price Good size and weight bottom load dispenser. Bottom load design is really convenient to use. Easy to setup and has good functional design. Good stainless steel look makes a great finish and modern look. Good even flow of water from both hot and cold pipes. Energy efficient and quite useful for home. I could easily fit it in near kitchen and eating area. Overall good value for the price.n Great water Installation on this item couldn't have been easier. It has been in use since 10 minutes after it was delivered to our door. The water that comes out is the perfect temperature for drinking, hot or cold. The water jug is on the bottom, so for a residence the look is perfect. In the front area where you dispense your water the ledge is far enough down that you can select almost any cup or jug to fill and it will sit there. We use the 5G tanks of water and it is very easy with it being a bottom loader instead of having to lift the jug on top of a machine.n Really Disappointed PROS: This is a beautiful machine! Love the way it looks and the front lighting. The metal \"straw\" and top is a fantastic idea, however, see below for my take on the topper.n CONS:To be fair - Glacier Bay JUST took over the company that created this monster. I have called Glacier Bay to express my dismay at the heating option as well as the cold water option, if you have a water dispenser that has (or supposed to have, HOT - COOL - COLD why do you have to turn it around, find the hole in the back and turn the dial with a screwdriver to MAX cold?!?! If you want HOT water, you have to press a button, wait for the heater to kick in, the red flashing light turns to a solid red when ready but the first batch of water each time you try it isn't hot, because it is already in the holding area, it is the next batch of water that will be hot UNLESS the light goes off or you wait to long to dispense it. SO FRUSTRATING!n The dispensing bay back is flat, so if you are trying to fill your coffee pot or pitcher, it will be a wet mess.n The metal top that goes over the 5 gallon water bottle does not secure. Plus, I absolutely hated the magnetic front door! I don't want to have to take it off and place the magnets to the side of the cooler, hook up the metal straw to the hook on that door whilst changing out the water bottles! WHY?!?!?! This is so not necessary. A simple hinged door that swings open is such a better design. The door fell off twice while I was trying to secure the metal straw on it. FAIL! It hit the floor and had to be cleaned. The machine will not operate unless the door is on which didn't help be trying to fill anything other than a glass.n Returning this within the week to Home Depot. Will wait to re-order this when Glacier BAy has had a full re-do on this model.nRead Less Great look, easy to load, and efficient too! This Water dispenser is pleasant looking as well as functional. Room temperature, Cold, or hot water for making coffee, hot chocolate and soups. The water bottle can be variable up to five gallon container. And it slides easily inside the bottom section. The adjustment of the 3 different water bottle sized is extremely easy to change. Much easier than the inverted water cooler I currently have which is sometimes messy and when lifting and inserting the 5 gallon jug you get pinched and spill water down the side of the unit. The bottom load water dispenser eliminates those problems. I also like the stainless steel finish which goes nicely with any decor or room. This one went in the dining room next to the table where it will be used daily without a doubt. Great product and energy efficient.When I first plugged this unit in I left it at the original setting for cold/coldest setting and found that it was extremely cold and ran nearly constant. I adjusted it after calling Home Depot and they were extremly helpful stating what to do and what I was experiencing with the unit is not problematic. After the adjustment it works and cools plenty. The heated water also excellent it takes about 3 minutes to heat up the water and it is ready to dispense. And room temperature water can also be dispensed for cooking or whatever your needs are. Great product that will be used daily at my house. Thank you Home Depot.Example: the drill was really easy to assemble, lightweight and not noisy. I am really pleased with the battery life and was able to use the drill without charging for over an hour of heavy duty use...nRead Less Almost excellent I replaced an energy hog, name brand, member club special, hot/cold dispenser with this Glacier Bay. I'm not running the hot feature; when the compressor kicks on there is a noticeable energy dump (my circuits are stretched to the limit, so electrical fluctuations are pretty apparent,) so I'll see what the energy bill says -- the Glacier Bay is Energy Star qualified, my old one wasn't.n I wasn't impressed with the positive reviews of the silly features this has, until I used them: the ~1\" ramp is a huge help getting the bottle in; the telescoping stainless straw seems a lot more sanitary over time than plastic straws; I had no problem getting 5 gal and 3 gal bottles in it, and the front panel push button controls is a lot easier than fumbling for toggle switches in the back. This is also metal on the sides and back, and the four point magnetic removable door allows you to sandwich this between anything and a wall.n Negative reviews have complained of pump noise; I may have lucked out but mine sounds like a full refrigerator's compressor kicking on.n My only complaint is the control panel itself: \"Glacier Bay\" is illuminated from behind with a blue light, which doesn't bother me in itself, but there is a lot of bleed into the four LED indicators -- you just have to get used to what the blue bleedthrough and a discrete blue LED indication look like. The buttons are membrane, they won't be used much, but membrane will eventually finger rot. If Breville made this, it would have stainless buttons set in illumination, about 40 of them, and a LCD animated display of how many h2o molecules you have left. And it would have been about 40 times the cost, so I can live with a stupid membrane panel for room temp+ to ice cold water in just minutes.n I don't think anyone gives you a bottle, but I have to believe the margins on them are pretty thick at twenty plus shipping. Twenty plus shipping with no water.nRead Less Recommended! Easy set-up - has three water temperatures - very quiet compared to our previous top-load water dispenser. The hot is very hot, but does have to be turned on a few minutes prior to use. Great for hot tea! Easy to load bottles - very nice looking in our office!n Makes my life easier. I have to say that I really do like this water dispenser. we have one at work that you load from the top, so when I seen this was a load from the bottom, I was happy that I did not have to lift a 40lb water jug over my head every time I needed to replace it. It has a very modern, sleek look that blends in very nice with my stainless appliances. The dispenser is simple to operate. for cold water, just depress the top square button on the right with the blue snowflake. For hot water, press the round red steam button on the face to heat the water, then when ready (after about 2 minutes) push in the child proof tab and depress the to left square button with the red cup on it. The water gets very hot, so it's nice that the added the child proof feature on this. It also has a button for water to come out at room temperature, so you actually have three options for your desired water temp. As far as noise, it's a bit loud when the reservoir is filling up, but that only takes a minute. When its just sitting, is sorta sounds like Rice Krispies sitting in milk, but you have to be close to it to hear it. As far as water consumption, it takes every last drop out of my five gallon jug, and I just go to HD to replace it with a new one when empty. It will cost you about $14.00 for a new full jug, but Once you buy the jug for the first time, you can take it back to HD for a new full one for around $6.00. Its like a propane tank deal where you have to buy the cylinder first, but then just switch it out for cheap when you need a new one. All in all, I really do like this water dispenser. Makes life so much easier when making a warm baby bottle, or tea and hot chocolate for the wife and kids. You will not be disappointed with this buy!nRead Less So far we are very happy with it.... We have only had this a short time, but so far we are very happy with it. The hidden, bottom load bottles are great, easier on the back and no ugly blue water bottle exposed. It is much quieter than our old one that died (well, the cooler part died, not the hot). The hot button takes a little getting used to, but for safety reasons, it is fine. I'm sure my kids would never be able to make the hot water button work. The only thing unknown about this machine is how long it will last. Hopefully it will be a long time, because even my wife is very happy with it. Happy wife happy life lol. Updates will follow......n Great purchase. The water cooler was very simple to install and put to work.n LOOKS NICE BUT POOR QUALITY The product is good only to a year after I bought it, actually after 6 months of using it, it produced annoying sound just like an air conditioning unit. It is so annoying especially when I wake up in the morning. I tried to call Home Depot about the trouble but I didn't get any response to resolve the issue, u thought the product is a good quality despite that it is expensive but I feel sorry for myself it's NOT.n absolutely horrible!!! I was so excited to have a new water dispenser but extremely disappointed that it is so loud (not due to uneven floors) it does sound like an air compressor on all the time. Unplugged it, emptied it and currently boxing it back up to return. I will use my old one until I can find another.n Nice water cooler, with small hitch This is a great water cooler, but it does have some very minor flaws.n first off, the lights are insanly bright for this unit, and there is no way to them off. this isn't a major issue, but i do have this in my bedroom (as I live in studio-style apartment) and the light took some getting used to/n The design is fantastic! The bottom loading system is great, and doesn't leave you with any spills, and it is easy to set up and install into the bottom of the system. The front face is easy to place back after a water jug has been installed.The system can also take 3,4, or 5 gallon bottles, so it makes it a bit more veristly.n One other complaint (riding on the coatstrings of the design topic) is the top itself. The whole unit is sturdy, and you would (and can!) easily use the top as storage. I personally had left a glass there for late night water needs. Key word being \"had left\". The system tend to rattle after it finishes with a cooling cycle. It makes very little noise itself, but if anything is on top of the system, it can get really noisey.n And, on the topic of noise: this *can* be a noisey unit. But only when it is pulling water from the bottle to feel the reservoir.n But, for the price, it is a reasonable unit, and I have no major complaints with it!nRead Less Bottom Load Water Dispenser It was everything it said it was. Exactly what I wanted.n Five star rated. Excellent. Best product recommended for every home and offices.n Never would recommend!!! This machine sounds like an air compressor when siphoning up the water to dispense. It looks great, I'll give it that but the noise that it makes is horrible. So much that we can't close the front because it will wake our kids up when it needs to bring water up into the tanks. We are very unhappy with this product and will NEVER buy a GB product again. We have even moved it all over our kitchen to make sure the loud noise wasn't occurring because it wasn't level or what not. We are very very dissatisfied with this product!!! I will give it one star only because it looks nice. We should have taken it back right away!!!n Bottom load water dispenser Very nice looking unit, clean design, easy to use and safety feature on the hot water is great for child safety.n The Best Water Dispenser We like the 3 water temp. Selections, ease of bottom loading & the stylish & slim design.n UPSET with missing part replacement I called customer service for a missing bottle cap at the top of the metal straw. The rep said she understood what I was asking for. Received a drip tray and grill instead of the cap for the water bottle. I have no way to seal around the top of the water bottle without it. I have already had the product about three weeks and still can not use it.n High quality, reliable product Right out of the box this item worked better than expected. After following the cleaning procedure, we loaded the bottled water and tested the kettle feature. The water heated up quickly (within the three minutes as advertised) and was piping hot for my tea. The cold water was nice and cold, without having to adjust it and the room temperature water was just that. The magnetic removable panel on the bottom was easy to remove and replace. Even if you don't get it straight on, it tends to slide in place once both sides are on. I also noticed the water jug was much easier to slide into the bottom, unlike other dispensers I've used in the past. I noticed there is a slight slope to assist getting the water bottle in with ease. The adjustable drinking straw reaches all the way to the bottom of the bottle leaving little to no water left once the bottle is empty.nRead Less Love the look & style,perfect on our kitchen counter.The col Love the look & style,perfect on our kitchen counter.The cold water is ice cold & the hot water is steaming hot.Like that the on & off switch is on the side of the unit.n Just set up today - easy install - hot water in 5 mins from Just set up today - easy install - hot water in 5 mins from start up - difficult to place full 3 gal bottle on unit without spillingn Does what it's suppose to.

I've now owned the PREMIUM HOT/COLD TOP LOADING COUNTERTOP WATER DISPENSER WITH CHILD SAFETY LOCK, BLACK for a month and must say, it is the best! I am very much surprised that I find myself making instant coffee vs using the pods from the \"other companies machine\" because the water dispenser gets hot enough (140*) to actually enjoy your coffee instantly, and it comes with a safety button on it to prevent accidental burns! Now, for the other side, it's cold water (47*)! How they do it, I don't know, but I do know that it's definitely an awesome product that deserves five stars! As far as counter space goes, very minimum space is needed as it only measures 12x12x19\", has a convenient drip tray, accepts either 3 or 5 gallon bottles of water, and I use mine daily!!nRead Less This machine makes it very easy and convenient to dispense drinking water without having to go to... This machine makes it very easy and convenient to dispense drinking water without having to go to the fridge or another appliance. I was a little concerned that it would take up too much counter space but it is fairly compact and we found just the right place for it. Easy setup, good instructions. we are using the three gallon water bottle with it as it is much les imposing than the five. Actually, we have been strictly using the cold water feature right now as it is too hot for any warm drinks but we're looking forward to being able to do a quick hot chocolate or tea with the heated dispenser. Probably won't save you any money but it is certainly convenient.n My wife works from home. When she's in her office she likes to stay in there, focused on getting ... My wife works from home. When she's in her office she likes to stay in there, focused on getting what she needs to done.

I recently built a bar in my home and had to have this product to complete the need! I made no mistake getting this! It has been a great addition to complete the need of my home-bar. Not only is it functional but also a great fit. I absolutely love the hot/cold feature. When I'm wanting a cup of hot tea, no problem, the hot water is instantly there..even for instant oatmeal!

We have for about a year since getting a new fridge that did not have a water dispenser (long story) been using large water dispensers in our fridge for nice cold water. It took up a ton of usable space we needed for food so when I saw this unit I immediately grabbed it. So much to say about this unit.First it has heating and chilled water settings. It takes about 5 minutes to get the hot water up to speed and about 25 minutes for chilled water. It will hold a 3 or 5 gallon water jug (I highly recommend OZONE WATER) It does not come with the water jug so you do need to purchase that. I would have loved to seen a Customer buys this with the unit but there was nothing.The hot water side has a child proof button that keeps kids from burning themselves and or accidentally being bumped. Chilled water side does not.Its a great looking unit. It has a water catch tray at the bottom so far I have not spilled a drop in it but its nice to have. It has a drain on the back side which is not overly convenient but i do not see the need to drain it. I now have been able to remove the water container from the fridge and have put my insta hot in the garage and now utilize this unit for my chilled or hot water needs. It makes a nice steaming cup of hot coffee. My roommate uses it for making instant oatmeal and soups. I see no bad here. I am looking for something better to set it on but over all for the price tag (and I have compared others) this unit is top notch and I highly recommend it!Also it has ready lights on the front. The far left shows power then heating then chilled water. if the light is lit it means its still heating or cooling the water> I have noticed the unit does hot the hot and cold very well without running the compressor much.nRead Less Simple in design and use, families will find this hot and cold dispenser really handy. Just reme... Simple in design and use, families will find this hot and cold dispenser really handy. Just remember you have to have a counter where it will fit with the 3 gallon bottle on top; the manufacturer suggests a table. Everyone, even a child, can use its simple paddle design for dispensing the water; just put the container against the paddle and gently push,,,presto! Hot or cold with clearly marked paddles. No need to worry about smaller children getting burned with the hot dispenser because there is a simple lock that children can't operate.Ideal for a small office setting as well as a home, you will find it useful and inexpensive to operate.n My wife has asked me a few times about getting a water cooler for her craft shop because sometime... My wife has asked me a few times about getting a water cooler for her craft shop because sometimes she needs water for her projects and sometimes for a drink of cold water and never thought how great it would be to have hot water also , so when we saw this counter top water cooler dispenser that also dispenses hot water , we decided to go for this model and liked it so much we also got one for our house also and they provide nice cold water and very hot water and even though we do not have any young children , the child safety lock is a plus and also like you can get it in black or white .n n/a Avalon Premium Hot/Cold Top Loading Countertop Water Cooler Dispenser with Child Safety Lock, Black. Itu2019s is a handsome appliance. The footprint is small. Has two recessed handles on opposite sides and a 70u201d power cord to provide plenty of reach for the 120v power outlet. It also has independent rocker power switches for the hot and cold on the left side of the unit. What a great feature for saving energy and safety. If you wish you could turn them on in the morning and have hot water fast. The water cools quickly. The evaporator coils are close to the back and it has a drain on the corner on the left side to drain the water from the unit. The front is very nice looking with 3 power LEDs one for the power, hot, and cold features. The drip tray is removable as well as the grill so they can be emptied and cleaned without much trouble. The cold side is blue and on the right side of the dispenser and the lever action is smooth. The hot is red and on the left side with a safety button you must also press to keep anyone from getting scalded, it's a smart setup and easy to use. Plenty of room for a tall glass under the valve. This uses either the 3 gallon or the 5 gallon water jugs. I did not know that you can buy those jugs empty and fill them with your favorite water and thatu2019s what we are going to do. Some water is better than others for brewing a great cup of tea or coffee, so we look forward to that level of control on our new machine. We are serious tea drinkers. n The unit is very quite. The red light goes out when hot. It took about 8 minutes for it to get hot. About the same for cool water. The photos were taken at 8 minutes. If you buy a bottle and it does not have a membrane on the bottle top so that the spike on the dispenser can pierce it, expect a mess when you flip bottle up. My bottle is open. I did find after sanitizing everything that the dispenser holds about 80% of a gallon. So after I rinsed it, I filled it with good water and then filled the balance plus the remainder in the jug and it was much less of a mess. I will get membranes so there is zero mess. It's the bottle I chose fault. I canu2019t be certain but think the hot water reservoir is large for safety and the plus of allowing several people at the watering hole to fill up. This is great, very pleased.nRead Less Well designed and manufactured water dispenser.

This was ordered online, and delivered to home. It arrived as scheduled. Setup was easy. I chose this model because it is one of the top rated bottom loading coolers. The pump only goes on when you are getting water, otherwise cooling motor is very quiet. I only use the cooling side, not the hot water. I had a top loading model and I do NOT miss having to clean up the little water which always gets spilled. It's easy, just insert the \"straw\" into the bottle then slide it in. There are four switches on the back -- one for cold, one for hot, one for the nightlight. and one for a cleaning cycle. I like the flat top, where I keep my cups, and the fact that it doesn't have a big ugly bottle sticking out the top. And its easy for the kids to use, because I find half full cups of water all over the house and outside. Overall, I'm glad I got this unit and not a cheaper top loader.nRead Less Little disappointed with the cold water does not get cold enough, also hard to fill a pot . Have...

It makes hot water instantly so the coffee lover or tea lover gets their fix with less hassle, and less time (that's the best part for my bottom line). The cooler is stylish, and actually a bit small, which helped me because I was able to find a place to put it in my crowded break room. It took a few hours to install due to some routing of the pipe, and a trip to my hardware store to get a short extension piece to extend the pipe from the sink cabinet to the cooler's final location. We had an outlet close by so that helped. n The cooler has a safety feature on the hot side where you have to depress the button and lever to get the hot water, surely to make it hard for kids to get burned if they play with it. The cooler spouts are low so kids can get to it. There is a door on the front you open to get to the filter. The Avalon replacement filter is available from Home Depot for $72, and it says it lasts 3 months and 750 gallons of water running through it. I would guess you could get longer time and more gallons to save a few bucks, it's up to you. We noticed an improvement to the city water through the filter, but it didn't make it perfect, there was still a little taste of something.n There is no drain, only a small tray to hold water so don't overfill or you will have a mess to clean up. One issue we have had is there seems to be a ratting sound that has gotten worse lately. It is probably the filter door because if you touch the door it stops. In a few days we will get our energy bill and then we will see how much power it uses since it is running all the time to keep the cooler function ready.nRead Less Pros - After 2weeks seems to be a good...

Got the Avalon Bottle-Less, Self-Cleaning Water Cooler Dispenser with Filter, as a replacement for an older cooler we had. Like other reviewers said, the instructions were kind of confusing and could be a little more clearer. But together, we were able to figure out the installation process. Filter easily snaps into it's holder and is hidden from view inside the base of the cooler, a big plus. But produces what in my opinion would be called cool water and more than hot enough on the hot side. The hot dispenser also has a button on it which has to be pressed before hot water will be dispensed as a safety measure to prevent small children from getting burned. The only thing in my opinion should be changed is the diameter of the outlet in which the water comes out. It seems a little small, which makes the dispensing of water a little slow, once again I'm only comparing it to the one we had previously. While I'm reviewing, I would also like to give a shout out to the excellent customer service. When we first got the cooler, after a week the cooler stopped dispensing water and it was determined by Avalon that the cold water tank wasn't filling. They immediately sent me a replacement and after receiving it packed up the old first one and sent it back at no cost to me. Replacement is running beautiful. Thanks again Avalon.nRead Less I got this bottle less water system because we buy a lot of bottled water and now we do not have ...

Plus my husband is disabled and in the bed most of the time so we just hooked it up in the bedroom right by the bathroom. It works very well.

This machine is great mostly because it has no need for the large heavy bottles. It seems to be made with pretty good quality. The only thing I'm not crazy about on this unit is that it didn't come wit a cap to bypass the filter it came with. I installed a large capacity filtration system for my refrigerator and I'm using it on this unit as well. No only is it redundant, it is unnecessary and a waste of money in my case. If you don't have such an outboard filter, than the buil-in filter is necessary. Overall, this is a good unit at a pretty good price.n CHEAPER THAN CRYSTAL SPRINGS!

Machine is quiet and sleak.n We are simply amazed by the Avalon Water Cooler Dispenser. We love the clean, contemporary look o... We are simply amazed by the Avalon Water Cooler Dispenser. We love the clean, contemporary look of this water cooler/dispenser, whichis equally suitable in an office environment, kitchen, family room or man cave.n We got this appliance as part of our plan to drink more water and less sugary drinks and juices, and it will definitely help us meet that goal.n Not only does it dispense pure filtered and tasty chilled water, but it also dispenses hot water, heated to 185 degrees, perfect for making tea with zero wait time. In fact, this feature may get more use in our house than the chilled water.n This product arrived well packaged, double-boxed to prevent shipping damagne. Included were two manuals, (one on installation and one on the filtration system itself), a large charcoal filter good for 6 months use, a roll of white PE tubing, and specialized 3-way stainless steel connector/shutoff valve - everything you need to install it, except for some white teflon tape,and your own adjustable wrenches.n It takes up very little floor space, so the main factor in the location is accessibility to a water connection. We opted to install our water cooler in our studio/family room, which was easily accomplished due to an existing faucet hose connection next to the well water tank. So, in our case, all we had to do was hook up a garden hose and flush the system, then attach the 3-way shutoff valve using some special fittings (also available at Home Depot - Everbilt 3/8\" dishwasher elbow, P/N LFA-158A and Everbilt 3/8\" cap LFA-105), along with some white teflon tape (not provided).n Of course, installation requirements will vary for each situation, and those who are not well versed in connecting water filters, dishwashers and faucets, may want to just pay a plumber to do this for you, as it is a moderate difficulty task for the DIY-er. Given that the entire installation took us only about 60 minutes, start to finish, it should not cost a lot to get this professionally installed, and is well worth it.n Once you get the special 3 way stainless steel valve/connector properly installed and leak-free, the rest of the installation is a snap.Just flush the new filter out and install the white PE poly tubing. Avalon supplies a special white plastic adapter that attaches to the included charcoal filter, so you can flush that new charcoal filter for 5 minutes into your sink before installing it. (We used a lobster pot instead, and a 5 gallon paint bucket would also work, as it's about 3 gallons of water required for the first flush.)n Next, you connect the white PE tubing to one port on the 3 way connector, and the other end connects to the back of the water cooler. There is even an extra plastic shutoff valve inside inside the bottom half of the water cooler, which also serves as storage space for the filter housing, manuals, adapters, etc.n Once water is flowing into the unit, you can flush through the cold water side of the dispenser on the front to get out any excess air, and then turn on the internal compressor which both cools and heats the water at the same time. It's quite an ingenious design, and best of all it's Energy Star-rated.n Cold water is almost immediately available, and heated water for tea becomes available after the unit has run for about one hour and the internal heat exchanger is fully heated up.n This incredible water cooler appliance also comes with an ozone-based self-flushing cleaning option, which you can use every few weeks to clean out the interior of the cooler, to ensure that there is no build-up of bacteria inside the internal components. The manufacturer also provides instructions on how to dissemble the cooler, sanitize it and remove mineral deposits, which should be done quarterly, especially when using hard water like we have.n Another great feature is the hot water on/off button which must be pressed before pressing your cup or glass against the red lever on the front of the dispenser to get hot water. This extra safety feature prevents possible scalding from the 185 degree water, which is essential in homes where there are children, who might be tempted to press on the hot water lever. They also include a special plastic strap, so you can strap this unit to the wall, so it cannot topple over, which is great for those with young children, or for anyone who lives in an earthquake zone, like the Pacific Northwest.n In fact, the only \"con\" we encountered, and it was very minor, was the product manual, which could use some revisions in content, grammar and more detail on the installation process. Also, there are a couple errors in the manual - for example, it states that hot water is available 15 minutes after the device is first turned on with water pressure, and cold water takes up to 90 minutes, but in fact it is the reverse: cold water is available first.n Installation manual aside, we found this water cooler/heater/dispenser to be an attractive and outstanding product. It would make a great Christmas gift for the home or office. It's a well-designed and well-made appliance all around that's well worth the price. We are quite thrilled with it.nRead Less This is a USA owned company and they proudly warrant the product and give you an easy to reach te... This is a USA owned company and they proudly warrant the product and give you an easy to reach telephone number. I am really impressed with the cooler. I attached the included tubing to my cold water in the basement and ran it to the cooler in the garage. It is perfect for our home with disabled children who can now get cold water anytime they want it (after I demonstrated its use). The water is so cold I no longer use ice cubes in my glass. It was a really simple install, the company having set up all the tubing inside. I simply attached the cold water tubing, screwed the filter in, flushed it as recommended and it was done. I might mention the safety \"trigger\" on the hot water paddle. It will not dispense water hot enough to make tea or an instant hot drink, until the button or trigger is pushed. A great safety feature for our home. BTW, the night light is a great addition that one can switch off or on.nRead Less 5 Star Review Rating provided by a verified purchasern Cold water is barely cooler than room temperature.

What a nice addition to our kitchen! Before this we were using a Keurig that needed to be filled up with water every day and you were always waiting for the water to heat up. Now we don't have to fill anything up, since this water cooler is hooked up to our water line that we already had running to our refrigerator. The great part is now we always have hot water, room temperature water, and cold water ready to use at the touch of a button!! Actually you don't even need to touch the button you can just put your finger in front of the button and it starts working! In addition there is a night light for added convenience. Included in this product is a carbon filter and sediment filter as well as a built in UV light filter! We have noticed that the \"Large, Medium and Small\" dispense buttons, actually dispense noticeably less water than the stated amounts. Also the cold and room temperature buttons will keep dispensing until you press them again to stop the water so pay attention or you will overflow your cup! The hot button has a safety feature that will only dispense when your finger is on it so you can't just keep the water running if you walk away from the machine. Installation was fairly easy with instructions to follow (took approx. 30-45 mins). Also be patient after hooked up, it takes some time to fill up and gt to the right temperatures but once that is done it works great!!

I decided to buy my own water cooler and bottles to try and save some money. It arrived in a timely fashion. My husband and I set it up and followed all of the instructions. After 1 1/2 hours, the hot was working fine, but the cold water came out lukewarm/cool, not cold. I called the company and spoke to a customer service agent. He pooh-poohed me and told me that I probably didn't set things up correctly and didn't have it running long enough (even though the instructions say 1 hour). He said to run it over night and it would be just fine in the morning. It wasn't. By the morning, the cold was coming out warm/hot. I called the company again and they told me that I need to ship it back to them so that they can evaluate it and then they would then send me a new one. I asked it they could send someone out to service it and they said that they do not have service people. It's a good thing that I found out now and didn't buy the extended service plan because there is no service available. Forget it. I'm not waiting for a product that should have been running right out of the box. I reinstated my delivery service and this cooler is going back to Home Depot. And I really don't appreciate being spoken to in a condescending manner and treated like a stupid woman from that CS department guy. I've had water coolers for 20 years - I know how to set up and operate one by now.nRead Less Easy to load. Simple to clean and the water stays nice a cold, but it can be adjusted Easy to load.

It heats and cools water fine, but it is somewhat inconvenient to use due to the low overall height and the small opening for a water glass.

Kept leaking from the cold water dispenser. Followed all the troubleshooting instructions but nothing worked. Had to keep a cup in place to catch the water. The buttons were a bit too hard to push. Also the height is just way off, it's more for like a child. It's just not very well made.n Better Than Expected Good deal for the price. Hot and cold water working in minutes. Took advantage of the free delivery as well. Only one small drawback, when you replace the water bottle, the reservoir is more shallow than other units therefore if you don't replace quickly, you will have water all over the place. Overall, very happy with the unit, wife and daughter love it.n Piece of Junk Do not buy this product unless you are a gambler. Unpacked the product, went through the complete sanitization procedure, installed water bottle. Flipped on hot water switch. Waited for hours, No hot water. Pushed the reset button, just to make sure. Waited for hot water and the \"hot light\" to come on. Nothing. Had to re-box the water dispenser and take it all the way back to Home Depot. Waste of my time.Home Depot needs to get this product off the shelf.n Does the Job It works well it is a little noisey when heating or cooling.n great water dispenser worked straight out of the boxguests were using it that day.n hot water also very goodn Works ok, but has flaws This is not a terrible unit from my experience, but it definitely has it's flaws, similar to what others have mentioned.n *review written after 1+ year of usen Pros*Price is reasonable and home depot offers extended warranty(I did not get wnty)n *Keeps cold water very cold and hot water very hotn Cons*Water flow is extremely slow for a unit with a dispensing button that requires a lot of pressure. While the water flow is one of the slowest I've seen, the few extra seconds to fill a cup isn't a deal breaker for me. However, when filling large containers, the amount of pressure required to hold the button down is very annoying when combined with a slow flow, even for a younger male as myself. I would not suggest this product for an older person or someone with arthritis in their hands.n *Cold dispensing button got stuck down and spilled a gallon of water on the floor while I was in another room. Issue was fixed by spraying button with some cooking spray to lubricate, but could have potentially done major damage to a wood floor.n *Red hot water \"ready\" light stopped illuminating after about 6 months (not big deal to me as it still heats the water just fine and I rarely use the hot water function)n Other than these couple of issues, I have had no problems with the unit. If you are a family that use several bottles per week, I would not recommend this product, but for an individual or light family use, this will work just fine.nRead Less Glacier Bay Hot/Cold Water Dispenser Smaller than previous (GE) dispenser.

It constantly drips water from the dispenser. Don't buy it.n Works Great I have always wanted a hot/cold water dispenser for my kitchen. I had chosen this one here and am very glad I did. This model is not too big or too small for my kitchen. The instructions were easy to read and understand. It was easy to install. The cold water is nice and cold, the hot water nice and hot. I can now drink and enjoy fresh water instead of from the tap. No need for ice cubes either which is a plus for me :)n A nice no frills water cooler We have been using this for about a week now and are wishing we would have got one sooner. It isn't as sleek as the under the unit models but that wasn't high on our priority list. We have well water with a very high iron content so prefer not to drink our tap water. I am surprised at how fast we are going through water now which is great, I would rather see the kid go get a nice glass of cold water then reach for a Mountain Dew. The temperature is adjustable for the cold water, we set ours about 3/4 of the way and it is ice cold. I measured the temperature of the hot water and it is right at 150 degrees, perfect for my morning tea. The hot water button is child proof so no worries about accidents. When it does run to cool the water it is quiet, hardly noticeable at all unless you are listening for it. Saves money on buying bottled water, we just refill em and put em in the fridge to grab on the go. So far this has been a great addition to our kitchen.nRead Less Decent for the price So, I read the reviews and decided to take a chance on this unit. Unpacked and setup per the instructions and ran the initial cleaning, but as others have stated, the hot would not work. So, i took it back and tried another one. Same thing happened on the initial cleaning, hot would not work. The manual states to clean with no bottle in and I was hesitant to try putting a bottle on if it was not going to work. So, I decided to call the 800 help line. The support rep knew of my problem immediately and stated there is an error in the guide and apologized. In order for the hot to work, you must have a bottle loaded and the pressure needs to build. So, I put the bottle on and sure enough the hot worked after it \"charged\".n I like that you can turn off the hot water feature when you are not using it.nRead Less Nice Compact Dispenser I've had this dispenser almost a month and had absolutely no problems with it. I love the small footprint which allowed me to get rid of a countertop water filter taking up precious space. Several reviews mentioned the buttons sticking and causing water leakage, I have not had that problem and don't know if it is something that happened over time. My only problem with the dispenser buttons is that they are very tough to push and hold while filling and I have actually had my finger pinched once when releasing the hot water button. Not a big deal for me, but for the kids I make sure to remind them to watch their fingers.n Other reviews mentioned that the drip tray was not removable for dumping and washing, that is not true. Since it was all put together when I took it out of the package I almost thought it did not come out, but a little tug was all it took for it to come out and get washed and it was simple to replace.n I like this unit and definitely recommend it for those who need a slim/small water dispenser that does hot and cold water. I have not found it to be too noisy or had any problems with the flow of water. The hot water has been perfectly hot, I have been able to make coffee in my french press with no problems. But once again, I've only had the unit a month and for long term issues would refer to reviewers who have had problems after the 90 day- 6 month marks.n Although I recommend it, I am returning it because I've \"upgraded\" to a bottom load model. We used this a lot more than I anticipated and I was getting tired of having to stoop so low to fill our water bottles because the dispensing area is pretty much toddler height- the consequences of a top loader in general, no fault of the model itself. With the bottom loader the dispenser part is higher up and I also like not having the water bottle visible Plus the model I went with for the upgrade offers the ice cold plus room temperature option, something I prefer because I was keeping the temp of the water on this model at the lowest setting and still putting water in the fridge for others in the house who wanted the ultimate cold. If I had a bigger house and room for a second unit I would definitely keep it, but for now I only need one.nRead Less Beware!

But that's the end of the positive things about it. n The water will not get cold. The plastic base is also literally crumbling apart. Every time I push a button a part of the plastic base crumbles off. The dispenser is now tilting precariously. It's been less than 1 week since I bought it. I'm taking it back. This is a terrible waste of money.n Stylish design, great functionality. This water dispenser looks great and would fit in great with any office (we use dispensers throughout our home because the water quality where we live is awful). It is a great feature that the hot water side can be locked to insure safety when small children are around. The only draw back with this machine is if you have an oversized container, it does become a two-handed operation because you have to hold your container and press the dispense button on the top of the machine.n Excellent water dispenser The dispenser came very well packaged and was in perfect condition out of the box. There is a power switch on the back to enable hot water production. The hot water trigger includes a safety release to protect from accidentally dispensing hot water; a good child safety feature. There are two small lights on the front of the unit that illuminate - red when hot water is ready and blue when cold water is ready. The hot water was available in maybe 10-20 minutes. The cold water took a little longer and was ice cold.n The unit is a slim design, very nicely finished and operates quietly.n Excellent Purchase Our old water dispenser completely died in the middle of the day. This was purchased online and ready for pick up, set up was easy and we have water now.n not good at all for refilling water bottles water is nice and cold but difficult to refill water bottles . only good for cup s. you have to bend to line up to spigot as this model is so much shorter .n Just what I need this Summer A great Hot/Cold Water Dispenser. Perfect size for the kitchen, living room, bedroom or even the balcony. It's white so it'll go with any decor. I love the height too. I'm 5 feet and can place the 3 (or 5) gallon water bottle on it myself. The cold water is cold and the hot water is hot, as described. Has push button operation w/child safety lock for hot water. Anti-Leak Bottle Support Collar. And best of all, is Energy Star. Now I can have cold water or hot green tea in an instant - when I want it.n Compact and attractive I have been around several water coolers in my day. This unit by Glacier Bay is a real standout! It is compact, attractive and offers not only cold water but hot water as well. A control knob on the back lets you select the cold water temperature.There is an off and on power switch also on the back to engage the hot water. The only problem I encountered was during the initial cleaning procedure. You have to remove the bottle support collar. I could not do it. It was too hard to get a hold of. My husband was able to remove the collar. From then on everything was fine. The dispenser works quietly and efficiently! I am happy to recommend this product.n Small, weak and Horrible Water cooler I bought it and when I got home and took out of box was so small that looked like a Barbie Water Cooler, also looked like such weak dispenser that I was afraid if I put the water bottle the dispenser was going to crack, do not recommend this product as definite will not last long. Cheap made.n Fits in Narrow Space This hot/cold water dispenser fits in a narrow space of less than 11 inches wide and 12 inches deep which is great because that was the only space I had left. The instructions had lots of pictures and no words and were a little confusing. The product comes with a bottle piercing tip as some water vendors seal the jugs or have a puncture top to them. The tower came with a collar to help balance the jug and holds the 5 gallon jugs (not included). The hot dispenser requires a switch in the back be turned on. There is an adjustment for cooler temperature. Once step suggest rinsing the cooler / lines with vinegar and water equal parts. The problem was the cooler does not drain 100% so a lot of water was used to flush the vinegar out. It is a nice cooler for a small space.nRead Less Great water dispenser!! Finally a we have a stylish water dispenser, no more drinking well water!! This unit will hold a 3 or 5 gallon water bottle. It has a thermostat on the back to adjust the coldness of water, very easy to operate with the push of a button. This unit also dispenses hot water, there is a safety switch on the back to turn off the hot water when not in use with a child safety switch on the front. The unit has a red light for hot water and a blue light for cold water. We love this unit, we have been using it for 5 days without any issues.n Great water cooler and heater! We got this Hot and Cold water dispenser to use at my wife's office. She loves this unit and so do her coworkers. You can get hot or cold water on demand. There is a blue light for cold and a red light for hot. As long as the light is on the water will be either cold (Blue light) or red (red light). The water is chilled and you can control the temperature via a thermostat on the rear of the unit. You can also turn off the heater for the hot water via a switch on the rear of the unit. The hot water dispenser has a childproof feature for dispensing. The whole office is happy with this unit and they all would recommend it!n Works better then I expected Reading some of the mixed reviews I thought It wouldn't work very good but I took a chance anyway. It works great the cold water isn't ice cold but it is plenty cold enough. And it can be adjusted. The hot water has a child safety system that makes it harder for little guys to turn on. The hot water isn't boiling but its fine for hot chocolate for the kiddies. Its smaller then some I have seen but that makes it easier to put the 5 gallons jugs on it. I bought a 3 gallon with a handle (also sold by HD) so that I can get my own free well water. I'm not sure where the UV inhibitor is but that is a big plus. We have one on our pond and well water system. Its stop the growth of algae which could happen if the water is sitting around for a long time.nRead Less Nice water cooler The hot and cold water dispenser is very nice. The water is both nice and cold and very hot. I put the water dispenser in my work shop so I can stay hydrated while working on my projects. The hot water is hot enough to make a cup of tea or instant coffee right out of the water dispenser. The water dispenser is quiet enough to have it in your din, kitchen, or play room. The child safety for the hot water is secure.n Excellent value Can't live with out it in Florida excellent cooler works greatn Easy to setup, easy to use It's one of those plug and play kind of item. Once you plug it in you can get hot and cold water dispensing from each spigot. Easy to setup. There is no mess with the leak proof bottle support system. If you are tall then you might have a bit of hard time reaching the bottom to put your cup or glass in. Otherwise this is good for the whole family. Kids can reach it and average size adults can too.n Compact Dispenser After having a water dispenser for year and to lift the five gallon bottles on top, this one made it easy. It short and compact but it does hold five gallon bottle. I was a bit worry because bending over bother my back but on it was put in place there no bending necessary. It take a little work to get it started but other than that it works like a charm.n Really enjoying it.... Once we learned how to work it .....Good deal.....n Quiet and cold Works very well and is quiet. Non-obtuse design fits well and blends in. Very inexpensive and as the compressor does not sound off.n first time try the wayer Dispenser It work great and is easy to set up and use. I would recommend this product to anyonen Always leaking after filling jug I love the ease of having a hot/cold water dispenser in my home; however, whenever you place a new, fresh jug on top of the dispenser, it WILL leak when you go to retrieve your water. It would be an easy fix if the cold button didn't jam, but that's the reason the leak happens. It could be the pressure of the lack of friction between the button and the dispenser itself, but the button used to dispense water gets stuck, and there you are frantically trying to get the button to pop up.n I would NOT recommend this product to anyone, especially if you have children in the home.n Water Dispenser We got this as an alternative to tap water or water bottles. The hot water is hot enough for instant coffee or a cup of tea or hot chocolate. It is a little low to the ground but for the price its something we could live with.n Looks good, but... Love the sleek design and low height. n However... even with it's most inconspicuous design, it is the elephant in the room. IT IS SO LOUD, guests ask, \"Where's that sound coming from?\" At times, I've had to unplug it to get to sleep. n The buttons are also a negative feature. They look good, but for an arthritic person they are more difficult to work, than tabs. And the hot water has never worked.n I've decided to move this unit to my office, and am shopping now, for a better model for my home. This time, I'm reading the reviews, and won't cheap out for the least expensive. Any recommendations?n Does the job for a good price It makes colder water than its predecessor, but the compressor is a bit noisy when running. Needs better shock mounts.n Happy so far.... Bought this for work. We use it a lot. The cold is cold enough and the hot is fine as well.n terrible product. I bought this unit almost 6 months ago and have never been pleased. It is loud! Makes banging sounds when heating water that can be heard from across the building. Won't fill the hot reservoir if there is less than 1.5 gallons in the carboy. The lines are plastic and make the water taste like plastic even when the carboy is glass. Does not cool to a low enough temperature or heat to high enough to make a cup of tea. The buttons only work when compress completely into the machine which isn't easy while supporting a glass or bottle with the other to fill.n Water cooler Water comes out too slow. Push buttons are too stiff. The cooler is kind of short. Gotta bend over too far to get water. Shelf that holds cup is not tall enough for very tall water bottle. Have to hold bottle the whole (slow) process of filling.n Commercial Client Satisfied This product was one specified by our client and they are extremely happy with it. It does what it says and without fuss. What else can one desire?n Not a bad unit Doesn't seem to be a bad unit, a little noisey at times. There is a little rattle when the condenser kicks on (to chill water) nothing excessively loud but is noticeable. Would not put along a wall that shares a bedroom. Besides that instant hot or cold water. Hot water has a safety button that at first I found annoying but now I don't even seem to notice.n Piece of junk Cold water died 3 months after warranty. Home Depot tried to work with manufacturer but Glacier Bay not interested. Unfortunately the same unit is marketed under several names. Be careful.n Dayana I love it doesn't take a lot of space and the hot water that comes out is super hot and has a safety feature just in case you have kids. Also it lets you know when there is cold water available.n item is very well made item is very well maden Only have had it for a few weeks, but seems to be working great.

The water is pretty cold and the hot water is really hot. The bottles that we had with our old water cooler are not the ones that fit this cooler. My old cooler was a pressure pump that filled the bottle with air and pushed the water into the cooler. This cooler actually pumps the water into the cooler. I could actually use the water bottles we had, the intake apparatus just does not snap on to the bottle securely. It just sets into the bottle.n Great water cooler Great water coolern So good so far.

I no longer have to hoist a 5 gallon heavy jug of water up, aligning the bottle's spout into a hole that looks smaller when carrying such a heavy load, and risking a flood each time. I've had many other water coolers, and this cooler by far, is one of the best dispensers out there.

Self-Cleaning Bottom Loading Water Cooler Dispenser, Whiten A NICE WATER DISPENSERBACKGROUND: This is the third water dispenser we have owned. It is an addition to go in our upstairs rental apartment.REVIEW: This is a nice, simple unit. The bottom water bottle storage is very nice and keeps the unit sleek and clean looking. The unit can use 3 or 5-gallon bottles which is very convenient. Three indicator lights show if the heater, cooler, or self-clean feature are in operation. There is an outlet for chilled water and one for hot water. The chilled water control is a simple push lever; press your container against the lever and water flows. Our 2-year-old grandson quickly learned how to fill his water cup. The hot water dispenser has a simple safety, you must press the button on the top of the lever, then press the lever. Our grandson has not learned to operate the hot water. The water is hot enough to steep tea, make hot chocolate, and start Ramen noodle soup. The unit does not have a room temperature water dispenser. The self-clean feature is a nice addition. Press the self-clean button on the back and the unit generates Ozone into the water to sterilize the system. The u201cPower/Self-Cleanu201d indicator flashes to show the system is cleaning.SUMMARY: An attractive, simple, convenient unit.PROS: 3 or 5-gallon bottles fitSelf-clean functionCONS: No room-temperature water dispensernRead Less We have owned several top-load water coolers in the past, however this is our first bottom load m... We have owned several top-load water coolers in the past, however this is our first bottom load machine. The appearance is improved, as this cooler is better looking without the big jug sitting on top. It is a high quality product that we are happy with as it delivers much colder water than any of our old machines, the bottom loading means less lifting and no chance of spilling water on the floor. Also, the probe does a great job of emptying all the water out of the jug, and the empty jug indicator is a great feature.n The self-cleaning bottom loading water cooler dispenser is just what I needed. I have always owne... The self-cleaning bottom loading water cooler dispenser is just what I needed. I have always owned a top loading water cool and with five gallon water bottle it is a little difficult but this makes my job lighter while being easy to load. I love the fact of control switches on back for light, hot and cold water and self cleaning. It allows you to have it your way.n I picked this one because we really like the other bottom loading water cooler we have, and wante... I picked this one because we really like the other bottom loading water cooler we have, and wanted another for the office. It is much easier to load the water into and no longer need to lift the 5 gal jugs (which makes my wife happy). The self cleaning feature I'm not too sure about yet, but time will tell. the pump is a little loud while loading water the first time, but not to the point of being concerning.n This is a very smartly and well designed hot/cold water dispenser. The best feature is that it is... I love this innovative water cooler. You put the water bottle in the bottom right side up. No more heavy lifting and spilling while trying to get that heave bottle over the hole on the top. Itu2019s easy to use with the paddle like spouts u2013 just press your cup or glass against the paddle and the water comes out. It has an efficient compressor that makes the cold water really cold. The hot water is hot enough to make tea, instant coffee or other u201cjust add wateru201d hot drinks. There is a child safety lock on the hot dispenser so that children donu2019t accidently get burned. There is a built-in nightlight so that you can see the spouts in the dark if you want to use this feature. It has a light that tells you when to replace the filter. It also cleans itself! It has a self-cleaning ozone feature that sanitizes and purifies the dispenser. This cooler can use the 3 or 5 gallon bottles. This is perfect for our guests so that they donu2019t have to come upstairs to get filtered water.nRead Less This water dispenser cooler/heater is great.

The best feature is that it is bottom loading, meaning you donu2019t have to lift the 3 to 5 gallon bottle more than a few inches. Better than that, you also donu2019t have to flip the bottle up-side-down! That is a major u2018smartu2019 design feature. Another great consideration is the self-cleaning feature. While I donu2019t understand it (a chemist could explain it I suppose), by pressing the u2018Ozoneu2019 button in the back, ozone is injected through the system to kill germs and bacteria. Yet another feature I like is the ability to turn on/off the night light, the water heater, and the water cooleru2014thus saving electricity if you donu2019t need one or more of these. It will save money spent on bottled water (i.e., the personal single size ones). While I consider this a u2018luxuryu2019 at home, it is a great addition for an office or lunch room.nRead Less Avalon you have no ideal how much money you save me with your attractive, neatly compact, smart, ...

Avalon you have no ideal how much money you save me with your attractive, neatly compact, smart, self cleaning water dispenser.I was not aware I had the option to store a 5 gallon or if needed only a 3 gallon huge bottle of water underneath hidden in a stored compartment. There is no way I could have ever picked up that size bottle and flipped it over to stick on the top of the dispenser as seen on display in offices, doctors offices everywhere!The entire size of the dispenser to store fresh clean water is less than countertop height and fits nicely in a corner in my didning room. I can now grab cold fresh glass of water as I walk out my back door in the hot summer days here in Florida, I can't get enough water! I was spending a fortune on bottled water.n This is perfect for any family, any sized home or apartment, requires so little space. I think of how many plastic bottles are being used I'm doing our planet a huge favor by making a small change.n I leave the dispenser plugged in at all times, it's silent. I have the option to flip a switch for ice cold water or flip a switch (this blows my mind) for hot water for a cup of tea, I mean it really gets hot! Instructions read 15-20 minutes but seemed faster. I no longer have to turn on the stove top and boiled water in my tea kettle. Avalon made drinking healthy easy, super easy! The 3rd switch is a Night lite. When the machine is running to warm water or to cool water (I'm fine with room temperature most of the time) the motor is very faint in sound as if a small fan is running.nRead Less This water cooler is very nice looking, easy to set up and I I chose this model because it is one of the top rated bottom loading coolers. The pump (operated by a compressor) brings the water up to the water collector and only goes on when the water is depleted. The unit is very quiet. I had been using a top loading model and it was difficult to load and also my back isn't in the best shape to lift the five gallons. This is SO EASY to load!! Just put the water probe into the bottle and press down, then slide into the bottom of the cooler. That's it!! No lifting. When the water is cooling or heating, the green or red light comes on. When the bottle gets low, a flashing red light will let you know. There are three switches on the back -- one for cold, one for hot, and one for a cleaning cycle. The taps are convenient, just press the glass against them. The hot water tap has a button lock to protect children getting burned. n Customer service is excellent. I had a question and was able to speak to someone right away for support. n Another plus is that the unit is very attractive and not too large. I only wish I had one years ago.nRead Less n/a This water cooler is very nice looking, easy to set up and I love the bottom loading of the water bottle. I have found that the room temp water is cool rather than room temp if the cold water switch is turned on. The unit is really quiet when heating water (I used to have to turn the heating element off on the prior dispenser because it was quite noisy). I did take the top panel screws out to clean it according to directions in manual before first use but I could not get the top off and it did look quite complicated so I took a chance on using it the way it came.

Give me a break here, it is at the end of November when it is not that warm inside and the thermostat is not set at its cold-max.n 2) There is no such thing as \"room temperature\" water by pressing the middle button. It functions as another cold button since water comes out as cold as you press the \"cold button\".

It's a slow process but coming along since we are doing the work ourselves in our spare time. When I saw this item, I had to have it. It's great that refrigerators a lot of time have cold water in them, but now a days, it's really nice to also have hot water on demand for that cup of tea or for the kids to make their instant noodle soup. This is on our counter in our kitchen next to our refrigerator. This does have to have a dedicated water line running to it, so if you don't know how to do that on your own, you will have to hire somebody to hook it up for you. This wasn't an issue for us as we hadn't hooked up the water line to our refrigerator yet, so when we did that, we ran this one too and it's good to go. It has filters to take out the impurities in tap water so you get nice, fresh tasting water.nRead Less works great works great and easy to installn This unit is a counter tops dream.

The Avalon counter-top water cooler has many great features that are useful and come in handy for all of your water needs. One of the main features that I like is that it is charcoal filtered and from the research that I did, it is the best. Phoenix has the worst tasting water and is not drinkable to most peoples taste. The filter is replaced at 6 months or 1500 gallons but because of the water we have here, it might need to be done sooner. I'm pleased with the taste coming from cooler and time will tell how long this lasts. It was easy to install and took little time.n Avalon Countertop Self-Cleaning Bottle-less Hot/Cold Water Cooler. Cooler fits in tight places. ... Avalon Countertop Self-Cleaning Bottle-less Hot/Cold Water Cooler. Cooler fits in tight places. Setup is easy, unit can be connected directly to your existing sink water line. All parts necessary for installation are included: NSF certified carbon filter, good for 6 months or 1500 gallons of water filtering. UL listed and meets Energy Star standards. Black cabinet color but also is available in white. The cooler dimensions are 12 in x 12 in x 19 in. The paddle spouts are easy to use; press your cup against the paddle to let water come out. Cold water comes out approximately 47ﹾ, cold enough to drink without ice cubes. Hot faucet is hot enough for tea or coffee at approximately 168ﹾ. For safety, a child safety lock on the hot water faucet is added. The hot water will not work without pressing safety hot water lock. No need to worry about accidental burns. The self-cleaning ozone feature sanitizes and purifies the dispenser, preventing the buildup of germs and bacteria. Another plus, there is a built-in nightlight that makes the water spouts visible at night. Also, a filter indicator will light up when the filter needs replacing. Overall this is an excellent unit. Will eliminate the need to purchase water. That alone is a huge saving.nRead Less Easy set-up. Easy set-up. Hot water is VERY hot. Operating instructions are not very clear.

The ... Finished installing our new Avalon countertop bottle less water cooler w/ hot/cold features. The instruction manual is written well and easy to follow the steps once you have accessed the cold water supply line. The system has its own filtration system that installs ahead of the unit to make sure the water is fresh and clean. We have a whole house water filtration system attached to the main water line so this is more of a backup filtration for us. The install was pretty straight forward and the unit works exceptionally well. The cold water is very cold and the hot is very hot. It has a safety feature to child proof the hot water valve and takes some getting used to. The combination unit is a great money saver. Previously we had used bottled water and as I get older the jugs seem to get heavier. This unit eliminates that hassle and is very stylish. It is well worth the price and is so handy to have around.nRead Less This review is for the Avalon Countertop Self Cleaning Bottle Less Hot/Cold Water Cooler. I am t... This review is for the Avalon Countertop Self Cleaning Bottle Less Hot/Cold Water Cooler. I am thrilled to own this cooler for many reasons. A very good reason to love this cooler is that it helps reduce your cost if you purchase bottle water. That in itself is reason to own this stylish modern looking Avalon Hot/Cold Self Cleaning Bottle Less Water Cooler.Another reason is that when you need hot water, for Cappuccino, Hot Chocolate, Tea, Oatmeal, instant Mac and Cheese, Cup of Soups etc, you do not get the coffee taste with your hot water, just pure hot water. That does happen sometimes with your coffee maker or Keurig, or whatever coffee maker you own.Another thing no grounds from coffee that i am so happy about. Let me tell you the hot water is hot, i am enjoying my Specialty Coffee Drinks so much, so easy to not have to go to my Keurig and get Hot Water, this is so much simple. This is a very stylish and modern looking Kitchen Appliance, takes up a bit of space, so if you do not have countertop space, you may want to think twice about getting this cooler. Do you want cold crisp water, well with this cooler you will get it at 47 Degree F, and also has a good taste. The Hot water is hot giving you 168 Degree F which is plenty hot water. Another nice feature about the hot water paddle, is that it comes with a child safety lock, for a child protection so that they do not get burn.We found that once you get the water valve; filter and the water line connected, all you do from that point is connect the water line to the back of the unit, turn the cooler on, and your ready to go. The most tedious part of course is the plumbing, if you have not done much plumbing, you may want to hire someone to install this cooler. But pretty simple and instructions are good. The instruction booklet explains to you how to clean the cooler every 3 months. The water filter in our case 2 improves the overall quality and taste while removing odors, chlorine, lead, and cysts. The recommendation is to change the water filter every 6 months.This is a bottle-less NSF Certified activated carbon filter in the cabinet and water line that can be attached to a water source included is faucet, filter, installation kit, spout, and wall mount. The cooler has an automatic shutoff, filter change indicator, indicator lights, twist and lock design. It weighs 31 lb.As i have stated the self cleaning feature, a self cleaning ozone feature sanitizes and purifies to prevent nasty jerms from accumulating.I am crazy in love with this cooler, and find i use it now more then our Refrigerator. It is so cool to see on our countertop, love that it is stylish and modern looking, love the nightlights and love that it serves our purpose.

It's clean in appearance and without the bottle will not be an eye sore in the kitchen. The ability to add instant hot water will be great along with all the water being filtered. The fact that it is stainless steel in appearance also makes it a great fit to our other appliances. I will post and updated review once we have this product in full operation!n The AVALON Model A5BOTTLELESS self-cleaning botteless water dispenser is a self-contained unit th... The AVALON Model A5BOTTLELESS self-cleaning botteless water dispenser is a self-contained unit that as the description indicates does not require changing water bottles. It is plumbed directly into your incoming cold water line. The unit has an on board water filter which claims to remove greater than 97.4% chlorine, 0.5 to less than 1um (which is very small) or 99.7% particulate, 99.99% cyst, less than 0.5ug/L (also very small) lead at pH 6.5 and 0.9ug/L lead at pH 8.5. These are the technical specifications for the unitsu2019 filtration capabilities. In layman terms, this is a very good quality filtration system. We have been using the system for about two weeks (and we use it a lot) and the unit thus far has worked flawlessly. The water quality in our opinion is fantastic. The unit features a self-cleaning setting which when activated lasts for approximately 90 minutes and eliminates bacteria and bio-film in the holding tank and water lines. This is an extra added measure of safety for clean pure water. The unit dispenses hot, cold and room temperature water. The hot water is definitely hot enough to brew a good cup of tea. The cold water is chilled to about 50 degrees and is very refreshing. My entire family has used the system and we no longer purchase bottled water which is a huge plus. Not only do we not have to carry and store lots of heavy packages of bottled water, but we are not using tons of plastic which is definitely not good for the environment. In regard to installation, the unit comes with everything you need to set the system up for use. I have attached pictures indicating the plumbing required. Prior to installing the plumbing, ensure that you have shut off your cold water supply and that the two shut-offs, one at the plumbing tee and one where the filter attaches are also in the off position. It literally took me no more than 30 minutes to install this system. The unit comes with a tee fixture that attaches to your existing cold water line and a high quality water line that attaches to the rear of you dispenser. After the plumbing connections are secure, you must install the A4 filter which comes with the system. After installing the filter you would turn your cold water supply back on, open the shut off on the tee and finally open the shut off at the filter. The unit will fill the on board tank at this point. You are instructed to then dispense water from the unit for about 5 minutes which is roughly 2.5 to 3 gallons of water. Make sure to check for any leaks at the connections that you have made as well as the unit itself for any signs of leakage. After dispensing water for the recommended time you may then plug the unit in and turn the cold and hot water switches to on. When the unit is ready, the indicator light on the front will go out and you are ready to use the system. Another great feature is that the on board filter is stated as lasting for approximately 1500 gallons of water. The unit will indicate automatically when a filter change is required. In summary, the unit is easy to install, delivers high quality drinking water (great for coffee too), is extremely quiet. As stated, above, we have used the system for about 2 weeks now and have thoroughly enjoyed this new water system. Personally I would highly recommend the unit if it continues to perform as it has in the time we have had it. At a price of about $300, I feel that it is worth the cost for the convenience, high quality water and as an environmentally sound alternative to water in plastic bottles. I hope this review helps anyone contemplating purchasing a unit such as this. AVALON has made a really nice unit.nRead Less It was shipped very fast and was shipped securely.

All in all nice bottle less water cooler. self cleaningn The most convenient water dispenser We are so happy with our purchase of the Avalon self cleaning bottleless water dispenser. It was so easy to install, it literally took just a couple of minutes. The best part is that this is finally a water dispenser that the baby cannot reach. The buttons to dispense the water is on the top of the cooler, not at baby standing level. A great feature this dispenser has over others is that there is a room temp option. Also a great feature is that the hot water dispenser has a child lock so even if the baby were to climb onto a chair, he cannot burn himself. No more water bottle deliveries or lifting the heavy bottles to replace the empty one. There is a self-cleaning feature which keeps any bacteria from growing. It is a very easy to use feature. There is also a built in filter which filters out lead, chlorine, and rust. This is such a pretty and sleek dispenser too! I'm sure you will be very happy with you're purchase as we are with ours!nRead Less Cold or hot whenever you want it This water cooler ticks most of the boxes that I was looking for in a hot/cold water cooler. The following are the pros and cons:n Pros: - Does what it says - gives you cold and hot water on demand - Easy to set up - just hook it up to your water line - QuietCons - Size - given that it doesn't have the big bottle on the base, I feel like it could have been at least a foot shorter - the height (almost 4') may limit the places it can be stationed.n I really haven't had it long enough to evaluate the filter life or self-cleaning feature, but if they perform as well as the rest of the unit, it will be fine. All-in-all I'm very happy with it, but couldn't quite give it 5 stars due to the size being unnecessarily large (really 9/10 rather than 4/5).nRead Less Just Like Bottle Coolers w/o The Work or Mess I finally got this installed in my hanger. Other than running a new water line and flushing the filter the install went very fast. I have grandkids around so installed the rear extended feet and it is very stable. The filter is taking the place of the bottle, otherwise it is just like ones you find in offices. The plenty cold water is very much appreciated in Arizona just now (July 2) and the hot while not needed now seems easily hot enough for my tea in winter. In my early office years I dealt with those heavy bottles that piled up in the store room. I suspect offices are now changing over to this technology.Our water here is very good from the tap and I can taste no difference through the unit.nRead Less awesome water dispenser shipped double boxed with enough cushion to keep it from being damaged.n Vary tall and really cool reminds me of a unit in a doctors office or cafeteria.I think the best feature is that it does not need jugs of water as it runs off the house water.The included filter is rated for 1500 gallons or six months which ever comes first, I did not want to burn out the filter that comes with it so I teamed it up with a water filter system that also came from home depot.So the external system will pre-filter the water, extending the life span of the included filter.you should use the Self-Cleaning / Sanitizing button weekly. It takes 90 minutes to run through that cycle.Followed by 60 min. to get the temperatures back to normal operating temps for the cold and hot water.If your just using the included filter their is a red indicator light to let you know when it is time to change the filter.n If you have a apartment, condo, or slab house you might want to use it as the manufacturer recommends.it comes with a T fitting and a 120 volt plug.so just mount it near a sink or other source of cold water and a outlet on a flat surface.as it does not have adjustable feet.n Now if you have a house with a basement, go find where ever you want to put the unit remembering that it needs to be on a flat level surface and your going to have to run both power and water to it.Like ever other water cooler Only cold water should be run to the unit.It should be plugged into a 15 amp circuit as it has both a heating unit and a compressor for the coolant for the cold water.The hot and cold water are on demand which is why you have to wait for the unit to get to operating temperature.n Their is a drip tray for water from the dispenser, it must be manually emptied as their is no collection system in the lower compartment of the unit.Their is a red bobber indicator in the drip tray to let you know when it is almost full.n This unit is NOT exterior rated, so before you decide to put this unit out side, that must be taken into consideration.Just as long as it is protected from the elements and winter water temps. do not drop to freezing, their should be no issues using this just about where ever you want to.So if you have a shop where you work on what ever or a pool pump house, dressing rooms, rest rooms, etc.As long as it is protected from elements it will work fine.If anyone does decide to put it outside, planning on using a cover for the unit, do not forget to bolt it to the ground, as it is not so heavy that it can not be toppled by wind as it only weighs in at 50 lbs.nRead Less Awesome Water Dispenser RE: Avalon Bottle-Less, Self-Cleaning, Hot and Cold Water Coolern When I was shopping for this, I decided on the bottle-less model so I didn't have to handle those heavy bottles on a regular basis.n Dispenser was well-packed at the factory, shipped and arrived in great condition.n Installation was easy and straight forward.

I installed a tee and connected from there.n The cold water is cold enough (for me anyway) that ice isn't required.n It even has a built in night light for those midnight water runs!n Easy to install and looks nice So far this hot/cold water cooler is great! Looks nice in the kitchen area. Makes really hot water fast. The cold water is cold enough that I did not need to add ice. Comes with most everything you need to install. I had to pick up a water valve that split off to connect the water cooler supply line. Filter is easy to access and change. Directions are clear and easy to follow. Install the water supply line was the most difficult and took the longest part of the install. After flushing the water filter for a bit the water was clear, cold or hot, with no taste or smell.

I am going on three years with this dispenser, it's still working fine and have not had one problem. I recommend.n Works fine for a basic cooler This is a pretty basic water cooler, which at this price point is about as much as you can expect. Even though there is nothing particularly fancy about this it does dispense cold water and that's what I wanted it for. I love seeing the kids fill up a glass of water to drink instead of reaching for a soda or juice. Make sure you follow the directions and rinse it out with a vinegar/water solution before you use it to get any plastic taste out.n Easy to use, cools and heats water nicely It's a water cooler/heater and it does what it is intended to do. Set up is easy. Just be near an outlet if you want to heat or cool the water. And there is a bracket that mounts to the floor and unit to help prevent it from tipping over. Other than putting a 3 or 5 gallon jug of water on it these is nothing to do to set it up. n If the bottled water that you use is laden with minerals and would be considered hard water you may need to do some service/maintenance on the hot water side to remove scale and mineral deposits, but that looks easy to do. The toughest part of this is getting the jug of water on the dispenser.n But this is easier to use and install than running a new water line and maybe a drain. If you invest in a jug style dispense look into a service for delivering the jug of water. n This is also a nice to have if you have water quality issues that can't be solved with a filter.nRead Less Nice product This water dispenser is very nice. It does a great job of both cooling and heating the water per your desire. It took me a little time to figure out how to get the hot water to dispense (you have to push the red button before you push the lever) as the instructions did not cover this. (If you try to first push the lever you cannot then push the red button.) My wife does not like the large, bright red and blue levers but those do not bother me. I like the fact that there are two power buttons on the rear, one for cold and one for hot. Hence, if you are using the dispenser primarily for cold water (and perhaps occasionally for hot), you can save on electricity by not keeping any of the water warmed by turning off the hot button. I did notice, however, that you can actually dispense hot water by using only one hand. You can do this by pushing the red button and pushing your cup against the red lever. Other dispensers I have used make it a bit more difficult to turn on the hot water, or, at least requiring two hands to do so. On the other hand, other dispensers I have used are not readily obvious how to simply dispense cold water. I think the large, brightly colored levers make this dispenser a good choice for households with children as it is very obvious which side to use for cold water. I would recommend, however, turning off the hot water power button in the back in such environments as the kids may figure out how to turn on the hot water and it can get pretty hot. In my household, we have found we use the cold water a lot more than the hot. We occasionally use the hot water for things like cocoa and tea.nRead Less Best Idea Ever OMG. I have always wanted one of these but never had the room for one. Now that I have room, I jumped on this. Being in a wheelchair, its a pain to keep going to the kitchen just for a glass of water or to make a cup of tea. I put this in my TV room so now I can do both without going anywhere. It is soooo simple to set up. Just put a bottle of water in it and plug in. Self explanatory to use. Red spigot for hot, blue for cold. Even my mother with Alzheimer's can use it. AS a matter of fact, this unit would probably be of use to many people disabled in a variety of ways. Spigot is easy to reach and simple to keep clean and its portable in case I need to move it to another room. I should of gotten one of these a lot sooner. I love it.nRead Less awesome The Avalon top loading water dispenser is a great looking hot and cold water dispenser. I love using the paddle spouts to dispense water rather than push buttons.

It also has a child safety lock on the hot water faucet.n Wow amazing water cooler I'm very impressed with this water cooler. Finally a nice sleek looking water cooler that also works wonderfully. I can either dispense ice cold water or steaming hot water. No need for ice when drinking water from here. The hot water is perfect for instant soups and coffee or tea. The build is really strong unlike some cheap plastics ones this actually has metal components. Definitely worth the purchase.n Just arrived, but so far so good. Water flow is excellent. Just arrived, but so far so good. Water flow is excellent. With young grandchildren around, I am pleased that I can completely turn off the hot water function.n Great Water Dispenser - Great Features & Value We have had different brands before, but this one is the best ever. I really like the flow rate - it actually has a decent flow rate instead of a dribble. The tray is big enough to set a cup on it and it has enough depth so that you can fill a tall glass without angling it. The hot is hot enough & the cold is cold enough. It does not have storage underneath, but I never really used that anyway. It is taller than most of the others. The child resistant hot is easy to use - just press the button first and then use the cup to push the lever....some of the other brands have hot water configurations that are difficult to use, but this one does not.n It is sturdy, easy to use Does what a water cooler should do. Bought it for the office and am completely content with it. It is sturdy, easy to use, and dispenses hot and cold water. Not much assembly to be done either. It is more compact than I had expected it to be, especially given how well it was packaged. It arrived very quickly via Prime and was triple boxed. Would buy again.n Absolutely great water cooler Absolutely great water coolern great cooler. is small enough to be discrete, but sleek enough to stand out. great cooler. is small enough to be discrete, but sleek enough to stand out.n Highly recommend this product.

Job well done. - Roel S. , Tracy, CAn Don't waste your money I have purchased 2 of these in the past year both have worked great at first but after a few months they have stopped working, you will put a brand new 5 gallon jug in the unit and it acts like it is still empty. I figured the first one I got might be a lemon but 2 in a row? Seems like faulty equipment. I use water dispensed from primo.n When my old rental cold water dispenser wore out after 25 plus years, I was given a replacement b... When my old rental cold water dispenser wore out after 25 plus years, I was given a replacement by my water supplier, but that cheap unit got more and more noisy over a period of 3 days. So, I decided to buy this Glacier Bay dispenser. It has nice features, such as the hot water dispenser which only runs when you need hot water. The dispensing buttons are very nice. The bottom loading feature is convenient, unless it malfunctions, which it likely will, resulting in no access to water. n To cut to the chase, the problem with this unit is the compressor noise. Unlike a refrigerator compressor, this compressor has an irritating pitch which is very distracting. And, as to runs every three minutes, it is especially annoying. I think the problem my be that the compressor is small and weak in order to save energy. If I can't find a quiet dispenser, I will either use an upright unit unplugged, or simply drink tap water. It would be nice to save $650 a year.nRead Less Not what I expected ... Not what I expectedn The instructions were hard to follow and the door for...

Kind of. n While we like the look of the cooler, almost immediately after set up we found that the magnets that hold the front door on are weak, and the vibration of the motor cooling the water is causing it. The motor will turn on, vibrate enough to disconnect the magnets; once this happens, the cooler stops cooling and heating the water. We're finding that we have to push the door closed several times a day, and the water is no longer cooled to our desired temp. Willing to amend the review if Glacier Bay (owned by Home Depot, from what I understand) is willing to offer a working replacement or a reasonable solution.n I believe the negative reviews may have been from people not allowing unit minimum of 12 hours in...

Heats up great and quickly for a cup of tea or whatever, then automatically turns off. I do wish the screw to turn down or turn off the cold water was as easy though.

I didn't read the reviews closely enough, because unlike water dispensers I've used in the past, you have to tell the machine to warm up water as needed; it doesn't have hot water at the ready. You also have to carry the entire door to the sink to pour out water that gets spilled into the drip tray because it's attached to the door and isn't removable.

I have used this exact model for a full year and it was a great purchase! The negative reviews worried me; so I got the extended warranty, but never needed it. For all the people who found problems and all the people interested in this model; I have some advice. I went to a store that had 3 or 4 of these, in stock. Then I picked the box with zero exterior damage. I brought the cooler home and I stood it up where I wanted it, in my kitchen. Then, AS STATED in the directions, I waited a full 24 hours before I plugged it in. This is necessary for any refrigerated appliance. It allows for the Freon, in liquid state, to settle back down after transport. If you use the button on the left you get room temperature water. If you use the button on the right, you get COLD water. There is an adjustment, on the back, to set the water to the coldness that you want. For HOT water, you first push the small round button and wait a short time for the water to heat up. It only takes a short time and it saves energy compared to my old GE cooler which heated the water 24/7. I use this for Ramen noodles and tea. It's only slightly longer to heat water than my Kurig and there is a lot more HOT water available. I am very happy with this purchase and I would recommend it to anyone.

You can't put a bottle of water in this thing without spilling water every where! Also, the nozzles are so close to the wall of the dispenser, that you can't fill a coffee pot or a small bottle without getting water every where! I must bend over completely and hold my 5 cup coffee pot sideways just to fill it. My blind son can't even use the darn thing for hot water in his cup of soup because it takes TWO hands to dispense hot water. Not too easy for a blind person. Believe me, you have to be very limber and talented to get water out of this thing. I would have loved to return it, but I ruined the box opening it.

I received this water cooler a couple of days ago, several days earlier than originally indicated. I had been researching self cleaning bottom loading water coolers for about a month. Most of the popular units had good reviews but many of the owners had trouble with leaking. That was my major concern. While there were some reviews indicating leaking problems with this unit, the customer service experiences seemed pretty good. So I decided to take my chances with this one. It's more expensive than some of the others but I'm willing to pay a little more for additional peace of mind. So far there are no issues. The instructions leave something to be desired; I got on youtube to watch a couple of videos before I started it up. I checked the few connections that I could see in the bottle compartment and found nothing loose. The motor or pump that you can see seems to be attached very flimsily but I wiggled it a bit and it didn't come off. Everything works well; the cold water is cold and the hot is hot. I am not using the hot water frequently so I leave the heater off. The unit does make some noise when it is cooling; more of a hum/vibration noise. Probably about the same volume as a refrigerator. The room temperature water is cool and probably good enough if you didn't want to hear the humming. The nightlight is dim but probably good enough to dispense some water in the middle of the night. Since it's only been a few days I can't comment on potential future issues. So far so good; hopefully it will continue to work well with no leaks.nRead Less Nice product design, really like the room temp option in add Nice product design, really like the room temp option in addition to cooled & hot water.n lOVE THE WATER COOLER!!! lOVE THE WATER COOLER!!!n Very pleased with finish as it matches our appliances as it is near our kitchen and others looked...

The Avalon Bottom loading water cooler dispenser is very convenient and ideal. No needing to lift a 5 gallon bottle to the top nor having an eye sore of it. You just simply open the stainless steel cabinet door and load the 3 or 5 gallon bottle into the bottom loading station while applying the probe hanger into the bottle. You have the choice to dispense hot, room temperature and cold water with a push button. The drip tray is easy to remove to clear out any excess drips or spills. The hot water dispenser is wonderful for hot tea/coffee, soup. I feel safe with the child safety lock push button. Once you have followed the user manual you will enjoy this wonderful water dispenser. I feel so much as ease knowing it's safer to load the bottle into the bottom loading water cooler dispenser versus our old top load water dispenser. This dispenser also has an LED night light switch and is rather bright. I really like the flashing red light to alert you when the bottle is empty. Super happy with the smooth black/stainless steel body. The 5 gallon water bottle is out of site. My family and I are really happy wtih the water cooler dispenser.nRead Less This thing is awesome. For those wondering budget wise, Water bottles (at least around here) are ... I am very pleased with this Avalon bottom loading water cooler. I had always wanted one, but my wife never wanted a large bulky looking thing with a water bottle sitting on top of it in the kitchen. Also she couldn't manage lifting a 5 gallon jug of water and turning it upside down. Avalon has the solution for all of this. The unit is black with a stainless steel bottom cabinet which looks great. The water jug is hidden in the bottom of the cabinet, so not only is it out of sight, but you do not have to lift anything. The size of the unit is 40\" high, 13\" in depth and only 12\" wide. It is not heavy and has a nice fold down handle on the back , if you would like to move it to other locations (I would remove the jug of water in the bottom first, lol) The convenience of having hot, room temp. or cold water as options in one station is something I have not seen before. This cooler is truely an upgrade! The set-up is easy. It has a long extenion cord and the controls are on the upper back and top of the unit. It also has a built in night light, which is such a nice added feature! Just read the user manual carefully, follow instructions, and enjoy!nRead Less Compact and easy to use.

For those wondering budget wise, Water bottles (at least around here) are around 12$ each, refils are around 6$. So the upkeep isn't bad. Sure changing bottles takes some muscle, but it's easier then running new plumbing right? n So, the dispenser itself. It is a very nice finish. Matches great with modern stainless steel appliances. Great for any household application where you don't have clean/filtered water and want some. It doesn't look like a cheap watercooler, it actually fits subtly among the rest of the kitchen. n This is also great for anyone that has say a basement or upstairs where they might want a fresh drink more handy than going all the way to the kitchen and back.nRead Less A great bottom load water dispenser that takes up less room due to its sleekness and the fact th... Compact and easy to use. Bottom loading dispensers eliminate the hassle of lifting and flipping over a 3 or 5 gallon bottle onto the top. This unit has a probe that reaches all the way down to the bottom of the bottle to use as much water as possible and attaches securely without tipping or spilling. Setup out of the box is quick but if you want to do the additional recommended cleaning before first use you will need to disassemble the top and internal container to add water directly to it and drain out the back.n This unit allows dispensing of room temperature, chilled, and hot water all from the same bottle. The pump and heating/cooling elements make a little noise but nothing distracting. There is also switch for a night light that illuminates the front surface over the drip basin. The basin itself also has a red float that will pop up when it needs to be emptied. There are also indicator lights when water is actively cooling or heating that turn off when it's ready.n All in all a relatively simple but very useful product.nRead Less This water cooler is very nice.

A great bottom load water dispenser that takes up less room due to its sleekness and the fact that there's no bottle on the top to look at. It gives 3 different temperatures of water and has switches in the back where you can turn off the hot or cold if you choose too. There's also a night light which is something iv`e never seen before now. Very easy to set this up and insert the straw into the water bottle then push the bottle into the bottom unit then close the floor -done! Takes 15 minutes to initially warm up the hot water & 45 minutes for the cold to get chilled. Another thing i really like about this unit besides the optional night light is that the water stream is strong so you get your water faster. Lighter unit to move around & a excellent value as well.I would recommend buying his water dispenser by AvalonnRead Less I plan to install this \"cooler\" in a covered Gazebo near our pool so both kids and adults need n... This water cooler is very nice. I have used the top loaders before and it's always kind fun getting the bottle on the cooler without spilling water everywhere. This one lets you slide in the bottle from the bottom without the hassle. My wife can't do the gravity fed water cooler, but this one is no problem. I first cleaned the unit like the directions said to, then hooked up my first bottle of water. At first I didn't realize that I had to turn the cooler/heater on. Once I realized that, I turned the heating/cooling on and had nice cold/hot water in no time. This unit uses a pump, so unlike the top loaders that use gravity to dispense, you're relying on a pump that pulls water up into the unit and into a small tank. The tank heats or cools the water, then dispenses. I am very happy overall. The unit looks nice and does what it should. I recently moved into a home with well water and even though the well checked out ok, I'd still rather have the bottled water on hand.nRead Less I have been very pleased with the cooler.

Works fantastic, there are three switches on the back you can choose to turn on or off, the red one for hot water, one for cold water and the other is to turn night light on or off. There is also a handle on the back of this unit to aid in help moving it. On the top of the machine are three button one for hot water, room temperature water and cold water. Very easy set up, it only took about 45 minutes to get cold water after plugging it in the first time. Very easy to dispense hot, room temp and cold water at the touch of a button. It is very stylish, and takes up very little space. I really like the door on the front of the machine where the water bottle is, all you have to do is swing it open to change the bottle. Very, very nice machine.nRead Less n/a I am remodeling my basement into different rooms and one being a kitchen area and so I was looking for a new water cooler for my home. I found this water cooler and I love it. I want to say that I first love the shape of it. I then love that it is stainless steel.

The buttons are easy to work and this product does everything it states.n Door or front panel very flimsy, If you need to fill up a picture of water it takes a long time...

I was going to buy the standard top load water cooler for $98 when I spotted this one saying it was a bottom load. I splurged and bought the bottom load. Not having to muscle a 50-pound jug of water onto a top load cooler was worth the extra money.The dispensing buttons are much better than some of the old types where the handles break off.n Water temperature control is set to about 40F. Hot water works ok also.n The only negative is the long run times when in the cooling mode.When the unit turns on to cool the water it seems to run forever. It runs about 45 minutes or more when it cycles on. n It is not too noisy but it is noticeable. We notice it as it sits within 5 or 6 feet from our easy chairs. n We talked with the technical people about the long run times and they said it was normal and had no answer and said take it back if you are not happy with it. Of course that is always a hassle also.n It seems this unit has a very small compressor for cooling as it is rated at only 75 watts when in cooling mode. This is about one tenth of a horse power compressor, which is very small. Most good sized refrigerators use about one third horse power compressors which would be about 7 times larger than the one in this cooler. It would be nice if they upgraded the compressor to shorten run times and the noise associated with them.nRead Less Nice looking cooler but it didn't even last 1 year.

I was hoping for the outside of the outer or black part to be made out of a stronger material. the top is plastic and the side not.It was hard to understand from the pictures how to adjust the line that goes into the gallon of water since it is for two different size water gallons.

The yellow flashing light lets me know when the water bottle is empty. The only improvements I can think of are a stronger pump for the flow of water and a clearer description of how the pump and cap are supposed to sit loosely on top of the water bottle.n Great!!!! Great!!!!n Great Water Dispenser! We purchased this about 2 weeks ago. We had a top loading cooler for years. It is great not to see that big water bottle on top. I can now load the bottle myself. Could never pick up the bottle on our old one. The water comes out cold and the flow comes out pretty fast. The hot water takes about 3 minutes to watm up but when finished it is very hot. There is a light that lets you know when the bottle is empty. There is a blue light that reads \"Glacier Bay and the blue light that stays on when the water is finished cooling. At night these lights light up the whole room. I like my house completely dark at night so this is a little annoying. Other than than I am completely satisfied.n Solid Purchase I went from a top loading dispenser to a bottom loading dispenser and it works very well and is very easy to use. This dispenser is great but I wasn't expecting the hot water to be delayed. You need to press a button for the water to be heated and it will be ready after a few minutes of heating.n Best purchase ever made on this type of product. Comparing this to my last dispenser....there is no comparison! I don't have to lift the 5 gal. water bottles (big plus) and they are easy to install. The water comes out at a fair rate with better quality. the cold water is icy cold, then there is room temp. and the hot is piping hot. Its not hot immediately, you have to hit a button and let it heat up for 3 min., which I figure is better as it saves on electricity by not having to keep it hot all day. The buttons are on top so you don't have to bend over to fill a cup (another plus) and the light provides a night light for my kitchen and directs you on where to lay your cup. Also, the price is reasonable.It's all good!n Good Idea - Poor Execution I'm not at all dissatisfied with the operation and ease of use. I'm extremely disappointed with the lack of quality and excessive noise of the unit. Aquarium pumps are inexpensive and much quieter that the water pump on this unit. I'm sure the mounting hardware for the water pump is light gauge metal because the unit vibrates more than it should when the pump is running. Also the compressor \"clangs\" when it stops. It's just another example of building cheap rather than building quality. If you purchase one, don't put it where noise will bother you.n Very nice water dispenser I rate this product 4 stars (good) for 2 reasons: 1. The instructions are pictorial with no text making it difficult to understand. Normally you would think a picture is worth a thousand words, but not so in this case. The layout of the instructions is also confusing; 2. It is very difficult to clean initially. Apparently there is a cleaning solution (which is not included)that can be purchased that probably would make it easier. It took 2 bottles (bottle water) to rid the hose taste from the water. Be sure to let the unit stand for at least 12 hours unplugged so the agitated (from shipping) refrigerant and oil can get to their respective places before start up. All in all I'm very satisfied with the dispenser and would recommend it.nRead Less Great Purchase Packaged very well not even a scratch. Set up was a simple task. Performance is excellent, we have gone through a 5 gal. bottle and replacement of the bottle was real easy. We really like the cooler.n Dead Out of the Box Ordered online, received yesterday. Per the instructions let it sit 12 hours before plugging it in. Imagine my surprise, and frustration, when it failed to suck up the cleaning solution. The pump ran but did not suck up a drop. Re-read the instructions, double checked everything. Tried again, still nothing. The pump runs for 20 seconds but fails to suck the cleaning solution up into the unit. Decided to try it on a 5 gal. water bottle. Nope, nothing! It ain't happening. Read the troubleshooting guide. \"Possible air pocket - Push down on the dispenser buttons to prime the unit\". Still no avail and not a hint of anything else to try.n At the bottom of the cover page of the instruction booklet is an invitation to \"visit us online to see our full line of products\" but there is no web-address. A Google search for \"Glacier Bay\" brings up Glacier Bay National Park, and Glacier Bay Bathroom and Kitchen Products at Home Depot but no web-address for Glacier Bay. Does Glacier Bay even exist? Or is that a name for products manufactured by a Chinese factory for Home Depot?n I can't wait to talk to the Glacier Bay customer service people today!nRead Less Did not last very long. Bought it at Home Depot. Very loud daily operation and when filling the cold water tank. Nice water temperature, but again very noisy. Today went to use it and there is some kind of liquid (not water) under the water bottle. Had it less than 2 years.n Glacier Bay Water Dispensor The water dispenser was well designed and easy to use.n No Flip, no spill..... I have been used to the old style, flip the bottle over, water coolers, and while they work great, lifting the bottle is a chore. This Glacier Bay model is perfect. The bottle slides in, underneath and the water is pumped up. It works great. It has hot, cold and room temp water. The hot water will take a min or two to heat up and has a child lock. This method is much better than having the water hot all the time as it saves on energy. This is a great addition to our kitchen, seeing that we don't have a water dispenser in our fridge. Overall it is recommended.n Best Purchase Ever... so nice to have it so so nice to have it nice to keep cleann very nice product I received my dispenser after a little longer wait than expected but it's OK I was happy to have it. the prior one only had two different water setting cold and room temperature. Now I can put away my warming carafe and just be done with it. Also it is nice not to have to pick up those heave water bottles just sort of roll them into place and this cooler match my appliances.n So Much Easier Than A Top Load Bottle Model I needed to get this Bottom Load Water Dispenser because of a shoulder injury. I wasn't able to use my top load bottle dispenser because I could lift and flip the 5 gallon bottle. Why didn't I do this sooner? I love this bottom load water dispenser. It is so simple to use and no strain or stress on my body and no water mess to clean up from the inevitable spills when flipping the bottle over. Super easy to use. I like that the straw for pumping the water from the bottle into the dispenser is made of stainless steel and not plastic. It is IMPORTANT to clean the water dispenser prior to using and approximately every 4 months as noted in the instructions. I add 10 drops of grapefruit seed extract to every bottle of water for additional antibacterial protection. Unit heats hot water in under 3 minutes from point of turning it on. Cold water adjustment is on the back and easy to adjust to your desired temperature. There is a built in safety feature to shut off the heating element when the water bottle is low on water. There is also a child safety button to prevent children from accidentally dispensing hot water. Nice LED control panel. I highly recommend this bottom load water dispenser to make life simpler! And it looks great with black and stainless steel!nRead Less No lift and Flip What I like about this water cooler the best is that I don't have to lift and flip the 5 gallon bottle and on my previous cooler when water bottle dropped on the pin it always feels like the thing is about to break with a big clunk.n The pump is a bit loud, however not lifting and flipping over comes this very slight annoyance.n What I would like to see changed is the hot water always be available, the way this one works is you push the button and wait for it to heat up. I'd like to have hot water on demand. However this is a nice energy saving feature.n Also, the lighted display could be used for something more useful then the brand name. For example, reminder to clean the system.n Overall, much nicer then my old style gravity feed.nRead Less Easy bottle replacement I received the water dispenser today, it is fairly heavy approximately forty pounds. The directions stated that if the unit was not in the upright position when it was delivered (which mine was not it came UPS)it must be left in the upright position for approximately twelve hours before turning on.After the letting it sit for twelve hours it was very easy to install the 5 gallon bottle of water in it the bottom door is magnetically attached and comes completely off,In a few hours I had nice cold water. I then tried the hot water it takes a couple of minutes to heat up (power saver feature) then worked great.n Beautiful, easy to use, no more bottles to waste and energy efficient, perfect Got it shipped fast, well packaged, easy to take out, very light to handle. Once unpack-aged it looks great, no fingerprints on the stainless steel. We really like the feature that it gives you not only cold or hot water, it also gives you room temperature water so no more mixing the water to get the room temp. Another great feature is that it can hold 3 gallon bottles as well, since the 5 and 4 are kind of heavy for my family to carry. In the back there is an adjustment for the temp of the water so it comes complete. We do not like to waste a bunch of bottles so this is the best solution and the dispenser looks great. Overall great qualityn No more flipping bottles. I've had several other top load water coolers and this one is 100% better. Very reasonable for the price and the features are all there. Low water indicator, and indicators for both the hot and cold temperatures. I like that it will not constantly heat water all the time, and allows you to press a button to heat the water, and then if not used for a while, will stop heating water. It only took a minute to heat back up, so about as long as I would wait for a microwave. I do wish it had a setting for how long to keep heating before it stops, but this feature saves electric and water from evaporation. The cold water cycles too, so this unit seems to be very thrifty on energy. It even has a room temperature water option if you don't need hot or cold water. The bottle feed tube is adjustable for different size bottles, but the cap does not actually clamp to the top of my brand of bottle, it just sits on the top, which is fine as it will not shift easily. The door is held on with magnets, so you don't need to worry about hinges opening the access door a specific direction and needing additional clearance, and inside the doorway is a door sensor to shut down the system when the door is open. I will say that I hate Glacier Bay manuals. I like to read my directions and these are all pictures that are not always easy to interpret. The manual must also be supplemented with a couple placards as the manual does not discuss how to adjust the tube length at all.nRead Less Beautiful new kitchen item This deluxe full-size stainless steel water cooler dispenses hot, cold and room temperature water. Features fingerprint resistant stainless steel cabinet, and easy to use push buttons controls, LED nightlight and ready to dispense indicator lights. This unit complements the decor of most kitchens with other stainless steel amenities. The on-demand energy saving feature rapidly provides steaming hot water without the cost of constantly re-heating water. This is great for making hot soups and/or hot beverages. Another nice feature is the easy to use push buttons with a childproof safety lock for hot water. Uses either 3 or 5 Gal. bottles of water, bottom loading, so no more heavy lifting for me.nRead Less Best purchase ever!!!! We put this in our fifth wheel, no more carrying gallons of water, every weekend. we only have to purchase two 5 gallons jugs, and they last a long time (our well water up north has a rotten egg smell). This bottom load water dispenser it makes life so much easier, you remove the magnetic door on the front, it very easily comes off (no hinges to break) and insert the drinking straw and slide the water bottle into place. It is as easy as that. I love having not to try and lift a water bottle on the top. We love this unit. It has hot water with child proof button, room temperature water and cold water. We actually refill our 23.7 ounce water bottles (fits under the spout with room to spare) to save on plastic going into our landfills! Going to purchase another one for home!!nRead Less The Best OOOH Boy!!! The best dispenser ever because I no longer have to aim the bottle in the little hole and I no longer need to clean water splash. This dispenser is very easy to use, simply open the bottom door, slide the bottle, insert the pump line and enjoy the cold water. The water temperature can be controlled from the back of the cooler. Its very quiet with minimal noise when the pump draws the water. The pump comes on for a few seconds. Overall, excellent.n junk got it home directions said if you laid it on its side don't use it for 12 hrs so next day I installed the water bottle and pluged it in when my wife got home she used it and the water would not stop coming out so I dragged it to the door and threw it in the driveway it was junkn 3rd time's a charm I ordered this as a replacement to a top loading cooler we have been using for quite some time. I really liked the idea of having the actual water jug hidden, giving a clean look. The first unit I received was defective, it had a leak somewhere near the compressor. Working with Home Depot and the supplier I was sent another unit which was damaged during delivery. Again the supplier was quick to replace it. I now have a working unit. I can only imagine the first unit I received was an exception to the rule, and the second unit was no fault of the supplier and they quickly resolved the issue. Now that I have had a chance to use this I have to say I really like it. The look of a bottom loading unit is so much nicer then a top loader. I turned up the chill adjustment because it just wasn't quite cold enough from the factory for my liking. I now get cold water at 38.5 degrees, perfect! I wasn't sure if I would like the kettle feature for hot water but it has turned out to not be an issue. When I want hot water I press the button and about 2 mins later it dispenses water at around 171 degrees. Great for my morning tea. I can hear it running when it is cooling the water or pumping water from the jug but nothing that is distracting. Even though I have had some issues I would still recommend this for anyone wanting a nice water cooler.nRead Less Great product Great water dispenser. Bottom load makes it easy to change the bottle when empty. I also love the hot water dispenser when I want a cup of tea. Just a few minutes and it's ready.

The Avalon water dispenser is great for hot and cold water dispensing. My old water cooler finally quit after 15 years. I was hoping to find a new dispenser that was as reliable, but quieter. The Avalon is very quiet, and provides very cold and hot water and uses much less energy than my old water cooler. Dispensing buttons are very easy to use and there is a child safety button feature on the hot. Water dispensing handles are large and have a linear water flow. I love the fact the hot water comes out hot enough for my tea that I don't need to warm up the water in the microwave anymore. The foot print of the unit is slightly smaller than my old one and is very attractive in look and design. The 5 gallon water bottle sits and seals nicely on top. My only wish is the power plug was a 90 degree style to minimize space required in front of a power outlet. Overall, I'm very pleased with this new Avalon water dispenser.nRead Less RE: Avalon ~ Top Loading, Hot and Cold, Water Cooler Dispenser A great cooler for home or office...

I did not see a hard water line hook-up for a possible water filter add on or direct water line. The controls are good but the hot water child safety still puts your finger exposed to the hot water coming out. The on/off options for the different water temps is a great option..

The bottom loading is awesome! The product didn't come with the necessary cleaning fluid...whatever that is...So if you're new to bottled water dispensers, like me, and don't know it has to be cleaned a certain way BEFORE USE, the water will taste HORRIBLE!! If you're like my fiancé, and have no taste buds, you'll never notice. But then like me you'll wonder how sick it's going to make you if you keep drinking it without cleaning it first, and you'll miss out on the first fresh cold five gallons of water!!The hot water, unlike the older style ones I'm used to using, has to be pre-heated before dispensing so you have to push a button to heat the water. I for one am too impatient for that. If I have to do that, I just as well use the same tea kettle Ive been using for four years to heat water for about a tenth of the price. The instructions don't tell you what kind of cleaning solution you need to buy so that's another downfall. I don't have any idea what to look for. Nor do I have the desire to spend two hours in the store looking for it. Not to mention the hours (or in my case days) that it takes for the cleaning cycle to complete. So overall, not real thrilled with the entire process. I'm sure there has to be an faster/easier to use product on the market for around the same price.nRead Less Got it undamaged, plug it in, and has been working...

I live in a 1400 sq ft. One floor home and this pump is extremely noisy. Not only is the pump loud but when it cools the water it \"clicks\". It's like electric base board heaters heating up. All I hear when watching TV is click, click, click, click. I only used the hot water once because it takes 3 min to heat up after hitting the button. Why not just microwave the needed water? It will be hot in 2 minutes from the micro. I would not purchase this model. Look for something without a pump and a quite cooling mechanism.n Love it.

I was renting a different make/model from a water delivery service and they raised the rent, so I decided to buy one. I am disappointed with this item. Cons:* Biggest complaint: I need to press the power button to get hot water. The other cheaper model has instant hot water. After pushing the button, I have to wait around for the water to heat up. *2nd complaint: This thing makes a lot of noise compared to the other one, all day/night long. Constant ticking noise and other annoying noises. Other noise: when the pump has to pump up the water from below to the reservoir. Mind you, this device doesn't have full time hot water either, so all this noise is due to the cold water. Yes, I have turned up (raised) the cold water temp, but still does it. I can hear it 50 feet away, in the living room, and I don't have great hearing. *The water pours out slowly due to the fact that it has to \"pull\" up the water from below to the aforementioned reservoir. The gravity fed ones dispenses water quicker, due to that fact, I suppose. *Unnecessary blue lightsPros:*Looks nice: blue lights (still unnecessary), stainless, and nice black gloss finish*Three water temp options*Easier to load bottlen I will be returning this tomorrownRead Less Fairly easy to set up.

The Avalon water cooler is a great addition to our kitchen. The cold water is the perfect temperature , not too cold nor too warm. It's refreshingly cold! The hot water is on demand and is very hot! It's perfect for oatmeal and tea. If you have small children you can control the cold and hot water outputs via switches on the back of the cooler. There is a child safety mechanism on the hot water dispenser. You can also turn off cold and hot if you want room temperature water. The cooler holds three or five gallon round containers, but also accommodates the rectangle type, although a tight fit. Water refills are expensive, so be prepared. New water with bottle is $13.99 and refills are $6.99, most places. Five gallons of bottled water costs about $2.49. Luckily, we have a self-fill water station at the beverage store for $1.00 per five gallons. We love the fact that the bottle is hidden underneath. That makes it easier to load and is more pleasing in appearance.nRead Less Much easier then the top loaders. I've owned 4 other top loaders and I have to say I like this on... Much easier then the top loaders. I've owned 4 other top loaders and I have to say I like this one the best. No more struggling to lift 5 gallons of water. And there is no way to drop or spill any water. Its a little pricey but quality and ease of use always cost more. The hot water heats up real quick and is hot enough for tea. The cold isn't super cold but plenty cold enough for a cool glass of water. But due to the very hot water they have added a child safety lock. You can put either 5 or 3 gallon containers in this unit. It is also self cleaning which is a great feature for keeping the water safe to drink. It also has an empty bottle light that goes on when the bottle is empty.n Really great features on this new Avalon 3- Temperature Self Cleaning Stainless Steel Bottom Load... Really great features on this new Avalon 3- Temperature Self Cleaning Stainless Steel Bottom Loading Water Cooler. Very easy to understand directions included in User Manual. Only takes one hour for the unit to be able to produce really cold, crisp water, and about 20 minutes for super hot water. Love that it is also self cleaning and uses an ozone system for this procedure. Energy Star feature is also an added plus, in my opinion. Bottom loading for either a 5 gallon, or a 3 gallon jug. I am delighted with the hot water feature for my evening tea, or hot apple cider, and also that it has child-proof features built in. Overall, a very well built quality unit. No corners were cut in the production of this water cooler. Great job AVALON, and also Home Depot for providing durable, quality equipment I look forward to many years of continued use. I also like the carrying handle on the center back, that was not mentioned in the Users Manual.nRead Less This water cooler is easy to use and has several nice features. First and foremost, it is a bott... This water cooler is easy to use and has several nice features. First and foremost, it is a bottom loading cooler. It is ascetically pleasing since you don't see a big ole jug of water mounted on top of it. That also eliminates having to lift up 40+ pounds and then position it correctly without wrenching your back, or spilling water all around. For this cooler, all you need to do is take the cap off of the water bottle, insert the probe into the bottle, and slide the water bottle into bottom of the cooler. n One of the nice features for this process is the probe hanger mounted on the inside of the door. You can hang the probe on there and not worry about the probe picking up dirt or debris off of the floor. n This cooler can cool the water, heat the water, do one or the other, or do neither. The heated water came out of ours around 150 degrees. The cold water comes out around 45 degrees or so. The heated water spout also has a safety button. The button must be pressed in along with the lever itself for the hot water to be dispensed. n Another feature this water cooler has is an ozone cleaning system. You simply press/hold for 5 seconds the ozone button on the back and the water tank is theoretically cleaned. The only way to tell anything is happening at this point is by the blinking blue light on the front, and also the occasional gurgling noise from the machine. Did I notice any difference afterwards? No, but my machine is barely 2 weeks old. n Another great feature is the night light. An on/off switch in the back turns on an led light behind the nozzles. It's enough light to illuminate the area around the cooler for easy access in the dark. n This machine is made in China.nRead Less Love this Water Cooler This Avalon Self Cleaning, Hot and Cold, Bottom Loading Water Cooler is the best water dispenser I have owned. I have well water here and have a reverse osmosis system fr the house but still do not trust the water for drinking. I purchase Spring Water for drinking and preparing meals. I love that this water cooler has child safety features, self-cleaning functions, safety features for preventing overheating, has a slim design that can fit almost any were and loads the water from the bottom...no more lifting to the top of the dispenser.n Works great, easy to use. This is my second bottom loading (one upstairs and one downstairs) water dispenser and I totally love them! There is no more struggling to lift a 5 gallon bottle up and over to try and insert it into those top loading units without spilling a whole bunch of water. Just insert the provided probe into your 3 or 5 gallon bottle of water, click into place & slip the bottle into the unit. The machine does the work for you! The design is great and I do like the night light feature as well.n wow The AVALON self cleaning , hot and cold, bottom loading water cooler is very good water cooler. I think the cooler looks great in my kitchen. It has paddles to operate the hot and cold spigots, very simple to use. There are 3 temp. settings, hot, cold and room temp. It holds a 3 or 5 gal. water bottle. I like the LED nite light feature that can be turned off and on.n Super nice water cooler Probably the nicest looking water cooler I've owned. The stainless steel and front panel LED's make this water cooler look great as well as add a nice touch to your kitchen. This has a very clean, modern look to it and really just looks great overall. The three water temp settings are really great on this. My previous unit only had cold/hot but the additional room temp setting is nice. Probably my favorite feature of this water cooler is the instant hot water. Previous units I've owned, you had to wait a couple minutes for the water cooler to heat up the water before it dispenses it but not on this unit. This unit pumps out hot water instantly and it's quite nice. No more waiting for hot water to boil. n Temp wise, the water is fine. The cold is pretty good but the hot water is hot enough for instant coffee/tea but probably not for something like instant noodles. For most needs, the hot water should be adequate enough. n There are switches on the back of the unit that you'll need to turn on prior to using the cooler. Seems a bit odd to me but you only have to flip them on once. n The only negative things I can say about this cooler is;n 1. The access door for the water bottle is hinged on the left side. My previous water cooler, the door was unhinged and held in place by magnets. As such, I was able to squeeze the unit into a pretty narrow place and still be able to remove the water bottle without issue. Since the door is hinged on this one, I have to space it away from my cabinet a bit in order to be able to open the door. This isn't a huge issue I think but more of a convenience thing for me. n 2. The siphon on this water cooler is plastic. My other unit, the siphon was stainless steel and seemed a lot sturdier. This issue is more of a durability thing than anything else. I think the siphon should've been stainless steel but plastic is suitable as well I think. n Overall, the instant hot water on this water cooler really does it for me. It's so much more convenient with this feature than standing there for a couple minutes waiting for the water to heat on other units. The modern look of this water cooler is a plus as well. Really nice water cooler.nRead Less Avalon water cooler Arrived on timeEasy to set up Hot tab very hot, cold water is very cold.So far so good..

However the unit it self is needs some refining. I found that it was noisier than I would like and cycled often to keep cool. The water itself was at a nice temperature for both cold and hot. The water quality however tasted no better than the water that came out of my refrigerator. I would have expected this to have a better tasting water similar to bottled water. Overall its an okay unit for its size and capabilities.n Arrived quickly and in great shape. Arrived quickly and in great shape. Easy to hook up to our water line.

Although this is a countertop model, it measures 19 inches tall and most kitchens have only a space of 18 inches under the wall cabinet. The installation is simple, but you have to drill a hole on your countertop or find some other opening to run the hose up to the counter. I'm using it on a bar area where there are no upper cabinets so it works out. The dispenser is nice and the water tastes great, but I'm concerned about the filter being so expensive when it's time for replacement. The competitor model sells their filter for half as much. You need to sanitize every 3 months and should use the self cleaning feature weekly. The cycle lasts 90 minutes. It's a nice machine, I hope it lasts.nRead Less We absolutely love it.

We got this to place on the countertop next to our refrigerator which has an ice maker, but no water dispensing capability. The set up was fast and easy and we pumped into the water line going to the refrigerator for the water source. The unit is very well designed and made, and is a great quality addition to our kitchen. We're still getting used to the controls, but both the cold and hot water features work well. It does not take up too much space and has added an additional level of convenience to our kitchen. So very glad we got this unit and very happy to recommend.n Avalon Bottle less water dispenser First to start it say that is counter-top water dispenser, it ... Avalon Bottle less water dispenserFirst to start it say that is counter-top water dispenser, it is pretty compact for all functionality that it contain.It does come with everything that you need to set it up and be ready for water dispensing, but I do have couple small problems, not with machine but with my kitchen cabinets. The cabinets are set to some standard 18u201d from the counter-top but this dispenser is about 19.5u201d tall which means it will not fit under the cabinets and that is the reason I'm giving 4 stars, another issue is water line, I have granite countertop in kitchen and to make hole in it I would have to have specialty tool, and Iu2019m afraid even to start (granite can easily crack)I went with different approach I got the shelf that is similar in base size and install it in dining area in the unusable corner and since I have basement under the area I run the water supply from the sink to the water dispenser and wola it worked.Now about water dispenser it really wort it you will have all different option for example if you are planning to use as a cooler than you do not need to turn the heater on or versa, and water taste great, no more chlorine taste and smell in my cup of water.It have activate Self-cleaning function and it suggested to be used every week, how does it work well it sanitize tanks and water lines and machine will produce ozone which will be injected in the water line and tanks. The cycle last 90 minutes and during this process manufacturer recommend not to use dispenser.Machine will cool water down to about 34 to 38 degree F and heat up to 185 degree F.The water filter should be replaced every 6 months or 1500 gallons.Overall I love it. I drink more water lately which should be good. The hot water is just perfect, to mix it with cereal or tee or even instant coffee. Other than that, it's great product for reasonable price.nRead Less Great product! It's so convenient. I always have cold water for my water bottle and my wife loves... Great product! It's so convenient. I always have cold water for my water bottle and my wife loves the hot water dispenser for making tea or hot chocolate.n The installation was easy. The kit is well designed and has all the parts you need. The only tool I used was a small crescent wrench to install the adapter in the water line. The rest of the tubing connections are all push-in type and go very quickly. The kit also includes a nice snap-in cartridge filter rated for 1,500 gallons of use and the design of the filter bracket makes replacing the filter a quick job.n This is a very nice counter top unit that will provide filtered hot or cold drinking water when you need it.n I am getting a lot of use out of this water cooler. The cold water is cold enough that you don't ... I am getting a lot of use out of this water cooler. The cold water is cold enough that you don't need ice, while the hot water is more then hot enough for making tea, hot chocoholic, or instant oatmeal. I like it better then using the microwave.n Installation is fairly easy. In my case it was complicated by the fact that the faucet has the water lines as part of the assembly, so I couldn't use the supplied cutoff valve. I had to change the cold water shutoff valve to a double output one.n This is a great dispenser. What I like about this machine is that the installation is very easy.... This is a great dispenser. What I like about this machine is that the installation is very easy. The only issue was that the dispenser couldnu2019t be placed on my counter-top so I will be using a side table near the kitchen. I first disconnected the kitchen faucet hose from the water feed. I attached the T-connector (this is like a valve diverter/splitter) that came with the dispenser to the cold water feed. I reconnected the kitchen faucet line and the dispenser plastic pipe to the T-connector. I ran this plastic pipe under the dishwasher and the counter to reach the dispenser located near my pantry. I attached this water feed line to another valve near the dispenser filter. After completing all the connections, I open all the valves. I was glad that none of the connections were leaking. I turned on the dispenser.n The first water that came out was very cloudy and I believe that this is just air bubbles. After a few more use the water came out normal. I did the first taste test with cold water. Compare to the tap water, the dispenser greatly improvement my water. It greatly reduces the bad taste from the water. I did a ph test with ph test strips of both tap water and the filtered dispenser water. The ph of tap water was about 6.6 and the dispenser was 7.0 (see image). The cold water had a good temperature. The hot water dispenser has a child safety lock which was not difficult for an adult to use. Water came out very hot, good for use with hot teas or coffee. I was very surprised that the hot water reached 180-degree Fahrenheit (82-degrees Celsius). I ran to temperature test and I got the same result. n The dispenser has a very attractive design. With all the features, this makes it a wonderful water dispenser.nRead Less AVALON COUNTERTOP HOT/COLD WATER COOLER I just received my Avalon Countertop Hot/Cold Water Coole... AVALON COUNTERTOP HOT/COLD WATER COOLERn I just received my Avalon Countertop Hot/Cold Water Cooler and I am so excited.n It made with innovation and a lot of style. It measures 12\" deep and 12\" wide andn is 19\" tall. I cannot wait to get this jewel hooked up. It has easy to use paddle spouts,n which really makes it much more convenient to use. You just press your cup againstn the paddle and the water comes out. This is a highly efficient machine. You can haven crisp and cold water at approximately 47 degrees Fahrenheit. You won't even have ton add any ice cubes or you also have the \"hot\" faucet, which is enough to make tea orn coffee or any other steaming cup of hot beverage at approximately 168 degreesn Fahrenheit. The manufacture even added a child safety lock on the hot water faucetn due to it being extremely hot so the entire family can use it worry free. This is a great n safety feature if you have small children. It has a great built-in nightlight so the spouts n are easily seen in the dark. I like this feature a lot. The water cooler itself is bottleless n with NSF certified activated carbon filter in the cabinet and a water line that can be n attached to your water source. The Water Cooler is UL listed and complies with all n standards of Entergy Star. It is easy to set up and can be connected directly to your n existing sink water line. It comes with all parts needed to get it set up. It also has an replacement filter indicator that lights up when the filter needs to be replaced. Thisn water cooler, being bottleless, will also reduce the cost of constantly having to purchasen water and will eliminate the strain of lifting bottles, which I am all for that. I have a lotn of difficulty lifting a case of water.nRead Less ... product is attractive and the cold water dispensing is w This water dispenser is absolutely amazing and worth every penny. First off it is beautiful! It as compact as possible for what it performs and even though it claims some counter space it doesn't take up nearly as much space as full size water cooler. Second it is BOTTLELESS that means no running out to pick up water and all the hassle entailed. If you are concerned about the water quality I purchased the basic water purification system. Our city water is almost undrinkable from the bad taste and chlorine odor. This system delivers pure and amazing water. My kids are drinking a lot more water now. For me the third and best feature is the hot water function. For us this was a big purchase and one of the ways I rationalized this purchase was we needed a new coffee maker. We had a pod system but because of our poor water quality it only lasted a year (this is typical for coffee makers in our house) Dreading going back to the stove top which takes too long we purchased this water dispenser. I can't begin to describe the amazing feeling of just running water into your french press and having coffee in seconds. Now this leads me to really the best reason of all to buy this product. I had previously and hastily reviewed this product at only 2 stars. If i'm honest that wasn't fair but despite all of the great features of this product I was disappointed with the hot water. A cup of tea or coffee just wasn't quite hot enough and I'll say again I was disappointed.nRead Less This is great!

It's a slow process but coming along since we are doing the work ourselves in our spare time. When I saw this item, I had to have it. It's great that refrigerators a lot of time have cold water in them, but now a days, it's really nice to also have hot water on demand for that cup of tea or for the kids to make their instant noodle soup. This is on our counter in our kitchen next to our refrigerator. This does have to have a dedicated water line running to it, so if you don't know how to do that on your own, you will have to hire somebody to hook it up for you. This wasn't an issue for us as we hadn't hooked up the water line to our refrigerator yet, so when we did that, we ran this one too and it's good to go. It has filters to take out the impurities in tap water so you get nice, fresh tasting water.nRead Less works great works great and easy to installn Works great!

This cooler is a lovely idea and a way to have instantaneous hot filtered water at your disposal. It looks and functions very similar to a deerpark office water cooler, but sits on a countertop and works off your 120 outlet and water supply. So, those are the two aspects that you have to account for. You need to locate this near a water supply. You do not fill it from the tap. It works similarly to a refrigerator, where you need a 1/4\" supply hose to actually use it. I do not recommend it for a kitchen application, as it takes up countertop area. However, it is awesome for a home bar or additional kitchenette area. It is clean and quite. You do need to plan on filter replacements.n Easy set-up. Easy set-up. Hot water is VERY hot.

Easy to plumb in and gives you a ready supply of hot or cold filtered water. Great for a beverage center in a rec-room or home snack bar type space. Hot water for tea/instant coffee/hot chocolate, and cold water for refreshment. Filter is easy to get to and replace. It does need a permanent connection to a cold water supply and it probably should be on a dedicated circuit, but mine is not.n Cooling coils on the back need to have air circulation, comparable a dorm or office refrigerator. There is a removable catch basin for overflow water, but no provision for a drain line, so be sure the kids know not to just let the water run.n Fantastic bottleless water cooler that fits on the counter! Historically, I have used only bottled water coolers in the home. A few weeks ago, I moved into a large, single-family home where we were using a Brita filter to have drinking water. Since refilling five gallon water bottles is just not financially viable for us, I decided to splurge on this countertop bottleless water cooler and I couldn't be happier. I had my plumber come and install it at the little mini bar at our home and it was up and running in less than an hour.n Have this installed in our new office.
